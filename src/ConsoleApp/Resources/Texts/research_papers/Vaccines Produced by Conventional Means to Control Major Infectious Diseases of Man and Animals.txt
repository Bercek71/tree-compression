Viruses in the family Coronaviridae cause important diseases including avian infectious bronchitis, transmissible gastroenteritis of swine (TGE), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), and human Coronavirus infections. Other coronaviruses may cause disease in calves, dogs, mice, rats, turkeys, horses, and parrots, but the diseases are of less importance. Coronavirus diseases usually follow a similar pattern, except for FIP. FIP is a chronic debilitating disease manifested as fibrinous peritonitis and pleuritis. The infection may be inapparent, but is fatal in a small proportion of infected cats. The immune response to FIP virus seems to mediate the disease; the immune response is not protective and antibody levels are higher in diseased animals. Immune complexes have also been demonstrated in renal glomeruli of cats with FIP.
Bovine Coronavirus causes acute diarrheal disease in neonatal calves (Mebus et al., 1973 ). An attenuated live-virus vaccine is being used in combination with an attenuated live-virus rotavirus vaccine to control calf diarrhea. The vaccine is administered to pregnant cows near the end of gestation and stimulates colostral antibodies that offer protection to nursing calves.
With the exception of avian infectious bronchitis, most Coronavirus infections have been difficult to control with vaccines. Perhaps this is because primary lesions are in mucous membranes of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, sequestered from immune reactivity. Coronaviruses produce about 15% of common colds in man, second only to rhino viruses. There are two groups of human coronaviruses that are antigenically distinct.

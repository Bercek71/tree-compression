STORY OF THE PLAY


The play is laid on an island somewhere on our planet, and on this
island is the central office of the factory of Rossum’s Universal
Robots. “Robot” is a Czech word meaning “worker.” When the play opens,
a few decades beyond the present day, the factory had turned out
already, following a secret formula, hundreds of thousands, and even
millions, of manufactured workmen, living automats, without souls,
desires or feelings. They are high-powered laborers, good for nothing
but work. There are two grades, the unskilled and the skilled, and
especially trained workmen are furnished on request.

When Helena Glory, president of the Humanitarian League, comes
to ascertain what can be done to improve the condition of those
overspecialized creatures, Harry Domin, the general manager of the
factory, captures her heart and hand in the speediest courting on
record in our theatre. The last two acts take place ten years later.
Due to the desire of Helena to have the Robots more like human beings,
Dr. Gall, the head of the physiological and experimental departments,
has secretly changed the formula, and while he has partially humanized
only a few hundreds, there are enough to make ringleaders, and a world
revolt of robots is under way. This revolution is easily accomplished,
as robots have long since been used when needed as soldiers and the
robots far outnumber human beings.

The rest of the play is magnificent melodrama, superbly portrayed,
with the handful of human beings at bay while the unseen myriads of
their own robots close in on them. The final scene is like Dunsany on a
mammoth scale.

Then comes the epilogue, in which Alquist, the company’s builder, is
not only the only human being on the island, but also the only one
left on earth. The robots have destroyed the rest of mankind. They
spared his life because he was a worker. And he is spending his days
unceasingly endeavoring to discover and reconstruct the lost formula.
The robots are doomed. They saved the wrong man. They should have
spared the company’s physicist. The robots know that their bodies
will wear out in time and there will be no new multitudes of robots
to replace them. But Alquist discovers two humanized robots, a young
man and young woman, who have a bit of Adam and Eve in them, and the
audience perceives that mankind is about to start afresh. Nature has
won out, after all.

ACT ONE

SCENE: _Central office of the factory of Rossum’s Universal Robots.
  Entrance R. down Right. The windows on the back wall look out on
  the endless roads of factory buildings. Door L. down Left. On the
  Left wall large maps showing steamship and railroad routes. On the
  Right wall are fastened printed placards. (“Robots cheapest Labor,”
  etc.) In contrast to these wall fittings, the floor is covered with
  splendid Turkish carpet, a couch R.C. A book shelf containing bottles
  of wine and spirits, instead of books._

  _DOMIN is sitting at his desk at Left, dictating. SULLA is at the
  typewriter upstage against the wall. There is a leather couch with
  arms Right Center. At the extreme Right an armchair. At extreme
  Left a chair. There is also a chair in front of DOMIN’S desk. Two
  green cabinets across the upstage corners of the room complete the
  furniture. DOMIN’S desk is placed up and down stage facing Right._

  _Seen through the windows which run to the heights of the room are
  rows of factory chimneys, telegraph poles and wires. There is a
  general passageway or hallway upstage at the Right Center which leads
  to the warehouse. The ROBOTS are brought into the office through
  this entrance._


DOMIN. (_Dictating_) Ready?

SULLA. Yes.

DOMIN. To E. M. McVicker & Co., Southampton, England. “We undertake
no guarantee for goods damaged in transit. As soon as the consignment
was taken on board we drew your captain’s attention to the fact that
the vessel was unsuitable for the transportation of Robots; and we are
therefore not responsible for spoiled freight. We beg to remain, for
Rossum’s Universal Robots, yours truly.” (_SULLA types the lines._)
Ready?

SULLA. Yes.

DOMIN. Another letter. To the E. B. Huysen Agency, New York, U.S.A. “We
beg to acknowledge receipt of order for five thousand Robots. As you
are sending your own vessel, please dispatch as cargo equal quantities
of soft and hard coal for R.U.R., the same to be credited as part
payment (_BUZZER_) of the amount due us.” (_Answering phone_) Hello!
This is the central office. Yes, certainly. Well, send them a wire.
Good. (_Rises_) “We beg to remain, for Rossum’s Universal Robots, yours
very truly.” Ready?

SULLA. Yes.

DOMIN. (_Answering small portable phone_) Hello! Yes. No. All right.
(_Standing back of desk, punching plug machine and buttons_) Another
letter. Freidrichswerks, Hamburg, Germany. “We beg to acknowledge
receipt of order for fifteen thousand Robots.” (_Enter MARIUS R._)
Well, what is it?

MARIUS. There’s a lady, sir, asking to see you.

DOMIN. A lady? Who is she?

MARIUS. I don’t know, sir. She brings this card of introduction.

DOMIN. (_Reading card_) Ah, from President Glory. Ask her to come in--
(_To SULLA. Crossing up to her desk, then back to his own_) Where did I
leave off?

SULLA. “We beg to acknowledge receipt of order for fifteen thousand
Robots.”

DOMIN. Fifteen thousand. Fifteen thousand.

MARIUS. (_At door R._) Please step this way.

  (_Enter HELENA. Exit MARIUS R._)

HELENA. (_Crossing to desk_) How do you do?

DOMIN. How do you do? What can I do for you?

HELENA. You are Mr. Domin, the General Manager?

DOMIN. I am.

HELENA. I have come--

DOMIN. With President Glory’s card. That is quite sufficient.

HELENA. President Glory is my father. I am Helena Glory.

DOMIN. Please sit down. Sulla, you may go. (_Exit SULLA L. Sitting down
L. of desk_) How can I be of service to you, Miss Glory?

HELENA. I have come-- (_Sits R. of desk._)

DOMIN. To have a look at our famous works where people are
manufactured. Like all visitors. Well, there is no objection.

HELENA. I thought it was forbidden to--

DOMIN. To enter the factory? Yes, of course. Everybody comes here with
someone’s visiting card, Miss Glory.

HELENA. And you show them--

DOMIN. Only certain things. The manufacture of artificial people is a
secret process.

HELENA. If you only knew how enormously that--

DOMIN. Interests you. Europe’s talking about nothing else.

HELENA. (_Indignantly turning front_) Why don’t you let me finish
speaking?

DOMIN. (_Drier_) I beg your pardon. Did you want to say something
different?

HELENA. I only wanted to ask--

DOMIN. Whether I could make a special exception in your case and show
you our factory. Why, certainly, Miss Glory.

HELENA. How do you know I wanted to say that?

DOMIN. They all do. But we shall consider it a special honor to show
you more than we do the rest.

HELENA. Thank you.

DOMIN. (_Standing_) But you must agree not to divulge the least--

HELENA. (_Standing and giving him her hand_) My word of honor.

DOMIN. Thank you. (_Looking at her hand_) Won’t you raise your veil?

HELENA. Of course. You want to see whether I’m a spy or not--I beg your
pardon.

DOMIN. (_Leaning forward_) What is it?

HELENA. Would you mind releasing my hand?

DOMIN. (_Releasing it_) Oh, I beg _your_ pardon.

HELENA. (_Raising veil_) How cautious you have to be here, don’t you?

DOMIN. (_Observing her with deep interest_) Why, yes. Hm--of
course--We--that is--

HELENA. But what is it? What’s the matter?

DOMIN. I’m remarkably pleased. Did you have a pleasant crossing?

HELENA. Yes.

DOMIN. No difficulty?

HELENA. Why?

DOMIN. What I mean to say is--you’re so _young_.

HELENA. May we go straight into the factory?

DOMIN. Yes. Twenty-two, I think.

HELENA. Twenty-two what?

DOMIN. Years.

HELENA. Twenty-one. Why do you want to know?

DOMIN. Well, because--as-- (_Sits on desk nearer her_) You will make a
long stay, won’t you?

HELENA. (_Backing away R._) That depends on how much of the factory you
show me.

DOMIN. (_Rises; crosses to her_) Oh, hang the factory. Oh, no, no, you
shall see everything, Miss Glory. Indeed you shall. Won’t you sit down?
(_Takes her to couch R.C. She sits. Offers her cigarette from case at
end of sofa. She refuses._)

HELENA. Thank you.

DOMIN. But first would you like to hear the story of the invention?

HELENA. Yes, indeed.

DOMIN. (_Crosses to L.C. near desk_) It was in the year 1920 that old
Rossum, the great physiologist, who was then quite a young scientist,
took himself to the distant island for the purpose of studying the
ocean fauna. (_She is amused._) On this occasion he attempted by
chemical synthesis to imitate the living matter known as protoplasm
until he suddenly discovered a substance which behaved exactly like
living matter although its chemical composition was different. That
was in the year 1932, exactly four hundred and forty years after the
discovery of America. Whew--

HELENA. Do you know that by heart?

DOMIN. (_Takes flowers from desk to her_) Yes. You see, physiology is
not in my line. Shall I go on?

HELENA. (_Smelling flowers_) Yes, please.

DOMIN. (_Center_) And then, Miss Glory, Old Rossum wrote the following
among his chemical experiments: “Nature has found only one method
of organizing living matter. There is, however, another method, more
simple, flexible and rapid which has not yet occurred to Nature at all.
This second process by which life can be developed was discovered by me
today.” Now imagine him, Miss Glory, writing those wonderful words over
some colloidal mess that a dog wouldn’t look at. Imagine him sitting
over a test tube and thinking how the whole tree of life would grow
from him, how all animals would proceed from it, beginning with some
sort of a beetle and ending with a _man_. A man of different substance
from us. Miss Glory, that was a tremendous moment. (_Gets box of candy
from desk and passes it to her._)

HELENA. Well--

DOMIN. (_As she speaks his portable PHONE lights up and he answers_)
Well--Hello!--Yes--no, I’m in conference. Don’t disturb me.

HELENA. Well?

DOMIN. (_Smile_) Now, the thing was how to get the life _out_ of the
test tubes, and hasten development and form organs, bones and nerves,
and so on, and find such substances as catalytics, enzymes, hormones in
short--you understand?

HELENA. Not much, I’m afraid.

DOMIN. Never mind. (_Leans over couch and fixes cushion for her back_)
There! You see with the help of his tinctures he could make whatever
he wanted. He could have produced a Medusa with the brain of Socrates
or a worm fifty yards long-- (_She laughs. He does also; leans closer
on couch, then straightens up again_) --but being without a grain of
humor, he took into his head to make a vertebrate or perhaps a man.
This artificial living _matter_ of his had a raging thirst for life. It
didn’t mind being sown or mixed together. That couldn’t be done with
natural albumen. And that’s how he set about it.

HELENA. About what?

DOMIN. About imitating Nature. First of all he tried making an
artificial dog. That took him several years and resulted in a sort of
stunted calf which _died_ in a few days. I’ll show it to you in the
museum. And _then_ old Rossum started on the manufacture of _man_.

HELENA. And I’m to divulge this to nobody?

DOMIN. To nobody in the world.

HELENA. What a pity that it’s to be discovered in _all_ the school
books of both Europe and America. (_BOTH laugh._)

DOMIN. Yes. But do you know what _isn’t_ in the school books? That old
Rossum was mad. Seriously, Miss Glory, you must keep this to yourself.
The old crank wanted to actually make _people_.

HELENA. But you do make people.

DOMIN. _Approximately_--Miss Glory. But old Rossum meant it literally.
He wanted to become a sort of scientific substitute for _God_. He was a
fearful materialist, and that’s why he did it all. His sole purpose was
nothing more or less than to prove that God was no longer necessary.
(_Crosses to end of couch_) Do you know anything about anatomy?

HELENA. Very little.

DOMIN. Neither do I. Well-- (_He laughs_) --he then decided to
manufacture everything as in the human body. I’ll show you in the
museum the bungling attempt it took him ten years to produce. It was
to have been a _man_, but it lived for three days only. Then up came
_young_ Rossum, an engineer. He was a wonderful fellow, Miss Glory.
When he saw what a mess of it the old man was making he said: “It’s
absurd to spend ten years making a man. If you can’t make him quicker
than Nature, you might as well shut up shop.” Then he set about
learning anatomy himself.

HELENA. There’s nothing about _that_ in the school books?

DOMIN. No. The school books are full of paid advertisements, and
rubbish at that. What the school books say about the _united efforts_
of the two great Rossums is all a fairy tale. They used to have
dreadful rows. The old _atheist_ hadn’t the slightest conception of
industrial _matters_, and the end of it was that Young Rossum shut him
up in some laboratory or other and let him fritter the time away with
his monstrosities while he himself started on the business from an
_engineer’s_ point of view. Old Rossum _cursed_ him and before he died
he managed to botch up two physiological horrors. Then one day they
found him dead in the _laboratory_. And that’s his whole story.

HELENA. And what about the young man?

DOMIN. (_Sits beside her on couch_) Well, anyone who has looked into
human anatomy will have seen at once that man is too complicated, and
that a good engineer could make him more simply. So young Rossum began
to _overhaul_ anatomy to see what could be left out or simplified. In
short--But this isn’t boring you, Miss Glory?

HELENA. No, indeed. You’re--It’s awfully interesting.

DOMIN. (_Gets closer_) So young Rossum said to himself: “A man is
something that feels happy, plays the piano, likes going for a walk,
and, in fact, wants to do a whole lot of things that are really
unnecessary.”

HELENA. Oh.

DOMIN. That are unnecessary when he wants-- (_Takes her hand_) --let us
say, to weave or count. Do you play the piano?

HELENA. Yes.

DOMIN. That’s good. (_Kisses her hand. She lowers her head._) Oh, I
beg your pardon! (_Rises_) But a working machine must _not_ play the
piano, must not feel happy, must not do a whole lot of other things.
A gasoline motor must not have tassels or ornaments, Miss Glory. And
to manufacture artificial workers is the same thing as the manufacture
of a gasoline motor. (_She is not interested._) The process must be
the simplest, and the product the best from a practical point of view.
(_Sits beside her again_) What sort of worker do you think is the
_best_ from a practical point of view?

HELENA. (_Absently_) What? (_Looks at him._)

DOMIN. What sort of worker do you think is the best from a practical
point of view?

HELENA. (_Pulling herself together_) Oh! Perhaps the one who is most
honest and hard-working.

DOMIN. No. The one that is the _cheapest_. The one whose requirements
are the _smallest_. Young Rossum invented a worker with the minimum
amount of requirements. He had to simplify him. He rejected everything
that did not contribute directly to the progress of work. Everything
that makes man more expensive. In fact he _rejected man_ and made the
_Robot_. My dear Miss Glory, the Robots are not people. Mechanically
they are more _perfect_ than we are; they have an enormously developed
intelligence, but they have no soul. (_Leans back._)

HELENA. How do you know they have no soul?

DOMIN. Have you ever seen what a Robot looks like inside?

HELENA. No.

DOMIN. Very neat, very simple. Really a beautiful piece of work.
Not much _in_ it, but everything in flawless order. The product of
an engineer _is_ technically at a higher pitch of perfection than a
product of Nature.

HELENA. But man is supposed to be the product of God.

DOMIN. All the worse. God hasn’t the slightest notion of modern
engineering. Would you believe that young Rossum then proceeded to play
at being God?

HELENA. (_Awed_) How do you mean?

DOMIN. He began to manufacture Super-Robots. Regular giants they were.
He tried to make them twelve feet tall. But you wouldn’t believe what
a failure they were.

HELENA. A failure?

DOMIN. Yes. For no reason at all their limbs used to keep snapping off.
“Evidently our planet is too small for giants.” Now we only make Robots
of normal size and of very high-class human finish.

HELENA. (_Hands him flower; he puts it in button-hole_) I saw the first
Robots at home. The Town Council bought them for--I mean engaged them
for work.

DOMIN. No. _Bought_ them, Miss Glory. Robots are bought and sold.

HELENA. These were employed as street-sweepers. I saw them sweeping.
They were so strange and quiet.

DOMIN. (_Rises_) Rossum’s Universal Robot factory doesn’t produce
a uniform brand of Robots. We have Robots of _finer_ and _coarser_
grades. The best will live about _twenty_ years. (_Crosses to desk.
HELENA looks in her pocket mirror. He pushes button on desk._)

HELENA. Then they die?

DOMIN. Yes, they get used up. (_Enter MARIUS, R. DOMIN crosses to
C._) Marius, bring in samples of the manual labor Robot. (_Exit
MARIUS R.C._) I’ll show you specimens of the two extremes. This first
grade is comparatively inexpensive and is made in vast quantities.
(_MARIUS re-enters R.C. with two manual labor ROBOTS. MARIUS is L.C.,
ROBOTS R.C., DOMIN at desk. MARIUS stands on tiptoes, touches head,
feels arms, forehead of one of the ROBOTS. They come to a mechanical
standstill._) There you are, as powerful as a small tractor. Guaranteed
to have average intelligence. That will do, Marius. (_MARIUS exits R.C.
with ROBOTS._)

HELENA. They make me feel so strange.

DOMIN. (_Crosses to desk. Rings_) Did you see my new typist?

HELENA. I didn’t notice her.

  (_Enter SULLA L. She crosses and stands C., facing HELENA, who is
  still sitting in the couch._)

DOMIN. Sulla, let Miss Glory see you.

HELENA. (_Looks at DOMIN. Rising, crosses a step to C._) So pleased to
meet you. (_Looks at DOMIN_) You must find it terribly dull in this out
of the way spot, don’t you?

SULLA. I don’t know, Miss Glory.

HELENA. Where do you come from?

SULLA. From the factory.

HELENA. Oh, were you born there?

SULLA. I was _made_ there.

HELENA. What? (_Looks first at SULLA, then at DOMIN._)

DOMIN. (_To SULLA, laughing_) Sulla is a Robot, best grade.

HELENA. Oh, I beg your pardon.

DOMIN. (_Crosses to SULLA_) Sulla isn’t angry. See, Miss Glory, the
kind of skin we make. Feel her face. (_Touches SULLA’S face._)

HELENA. Oh, no, no.

DOMIN. (_Examining SULLA’S hand_) You wouldn’t know that she’s made of
different material from us, would you? Turn ’round, Sulla. (_SULLA does
so. Circles twice._)

HELENA. Oh, stop, stop.

DOMIN. Talk to Miss Glory, Sulla. (_Examines hair of SULLA._)

SULLA. Please sit down. (_HELENA sits on couch._) Did you have a
pleasant crossing? (_Fixes her hair._)

HELENA. Oh, yes, certainly.

SULLA. Don’t go back on the _Amelia_, Miss Glory, the barometer is
falling steadily. Wait for the _Pennsylvania_. That’s a good powerful
vessel.

DOMIN. What’s its speed?

SULLA. Forty knots an hour. Fifty thousand tons. One of the latest
vessels, Miss Glory.

HELENA. Thank you.

SULLA. A crew of fifteen hundred, Captain Harpy, eight boilers--

DOMIN. That’ll do, Sulla. Now show us your knowledge of French.

HELENA. You know French?

SULLA. Oui! Madame! I know four languages. I can write: “Dear Sir,
Monsieur, Geehrter Herr, Cteny pane.”

HELENA. (_Jumping up, crosses to SULLA_) Oh, that’s absurd! Sulla isn’t
a Robot. Sulla is a girl like me. Sulla, this is outrageous--Why do you
take part in such a hoax?

SULLA. I am a Robot.

HELENA. No, no, you are not telling the truth. (_She catches the amused
expression on DOMIN’S face_) I know they have forced you to do it for
an advertisement. Sulla, you are a girl like me, aren’t you? (_Looks at
him._)

DOMIN. I’m sorry, Miss Glory. _Sulla is a Robot._

HELENA. It’s a lie!

DOMIN. What? (_Pushes button on desk_) Well, then I must _convince_
you. (_Enter MARIUS R.C. He stands just inside the door._) Marius, take
Sulla into the dissecting room, and tell them to open her up at once.
(_MARIUS moves toward C._)

HELENA. Where?

DOMIN. Into the dissecting room. When they’ve _cut her open_, you can
go and have a look. (_MARIUS makes a start toward SULLA._)

HELENA. (_Stopping MARIUS_) No! No!

DOMIN. Excuse me, you spoke of lies.

HELENA. You wouldn’t have her killed?

DOMIN. You can’t kill machines. Sulla! (_MARIUS one step forward, one
arm out. SULLA makes a move toward R. door._)

HELENA. (_Moves a step R._) Don’t be afraid, Sulla. I won’t let you go.
Tell me, my dear-- (_Takes her hand_) --are they always so cruel to
you? You mustn’t put up with it, Sulla. You mustn’t.

SULLA. I am a Robot.

HELENA. That doesn’t matter. Robots are just as good as we are. Sulla,
you wouldn’t let yourself be cut to pieces?

SULLA. Yes. (_Hand away._)

HELENA. Oh, you’re not afraid of death, then?

SULLA. I cannot tell, Miss Glory.

HELENA. Do you know what would happen to you in there?

SULLA. Yes, I should cease to move.

HELENA. How dreadful! (_Looks at SULLA._)

DOMIN. Marius, tell Miss Glory what you are? (_Turns to HELENA._)

MARIUS. (_To HELENA_) Marius, the Robot.

DOMIN. Would you take Sulla into the dissecting room?

MARIUS. (_Turns to DOMIN_) Yes.

DOMIN. Would you be sorry for her?

MARIUS. (_Pause_) I cannot tell.

DOMIN. What would happen to her?

MARIUS. She would cease to move. They would put her into the stamping
mill.

DOMIN. That is death, Marius. Aren’t you afraid of death?

MARIUS. No.

DOMIN. You see, Miss Glory, the Robots have no interest in life. They
have no enjoyments. They are _less_ than so much grass.

HELENA. Oh, stop. Please send them away.

DOMIN. (_Pushes button_) Marius, Sulla, you may go. (_MARIUS pivots and
exits R. SULLA exits L._)

HELENA. How terrible! (_To C._) It’s outrageous what you are doing.
(_He takes her hand._)

DOMIN. Why outrageous? (_His hand over hers. Laughing._)

HELENA. I don’t know, but it is. Why do you call her “Sulla”?

DOMIN. Isn’t it a nice name? (_Hand away._)

HELENA. It’s a man’s name. Sulla was a Roman General.

DOMIN. What! Oh! (_Laughs_) We thought that Marius and Sulla were
lovers.

HELENA. (_Indignantly_) Marius and Sulla were generals and fought
against each other in the year--I’ve forgotten now.

DOMIN. (_Laughing_) Come here to the window. (_He goes to window C._)

HELENA. What?

DOMIN. Come here. (_She goes._) Do you see anything? (_Takes her arm.
She is on his R._)

HELENA. Bricklayers.

DOMIN. Robots. All our work people are Robots. And down there, can you
see anything?

HELENA. Some sort of office.

DOMIN. A counting house. And in it--

HELENA. A lot of officials.

DOMIN. Robots! All our officials are Robots. And when you see the
factory-- (_Noon WHISTLE blows. She is scared; puts arm on DOMIN. He
laughs_) If we don’t blow the whistle the Robots won’t stop working. In
two hours I’ll show you the kneading trough. (_BOTH come down stage.
HELENA is L.C. and DOMIN is R.C., arm in arm._)

HELENA. Kneading trough?

DOMIN. The pestle for beating up the paste. In each one we mix the
ingredients for a thousand Robots at one operation. Then there are the
vats for the preparation of liver, brains, and so on. Then you will
see the bone factory. After that I’ll show you the spinning mill.

HELENA. Spinning mill?

DOMIN. Yes. For weaving nerves and veins. Miles and miles of digestive
tubes pass through it at a time.

HELENA. (_Watching his gestures_) Mayn’t we talk about something else?

DOMIN. Perhaps it would be better. There’s only a _handful_ of us among
a hundred thousand Robots, and _not one woman_. We talk nothing but the
factory _all_ day, and _every_ day. It’s just as if we were under a
curse, Miss Glory.

HELENA. I’m _sorry_ I said that you were lying. (_A KNOCK at door R._)

DOMIN. Come in. (_He is C._)

  (_From R. enter DR. GALL, DR. FABRY, ALQUIST and DR. HALLEMEIER. ALL
  act formal--conscious. ALL click heels as introduced._)

DR. GALL. (_Noisily_) I beg your pardon. I hope we don’t intrude.

DOMIN. No, no. Come in. Miss Glory, here are Gall, Fabry, Alquist,
Hallemeier. This is President Glory’s daughter. (_ALL move to her and
shake her hand._)

HELENA. How do you do?

FABRY. We had no idea--

DR. GALL. Highly honored, I’m sure--

ALQUIST. Welcome, Miss Glory.

BUSMAN. (_Rushes in from R._) Hello, what’s up?

DOMIN. Come in, Busman. This is President Glory’s daughter. This is
Busman, Miss Glory.

BUSMAN. By Jove, that’s fine. (_ALL click heels. He crowds in and
shakes her hand_) Miss Glory, may we send a cablegram to the papers
about your arrival?

HELENA. No, no, please don’t.

DOMIN. Sit down, please, Miss Glory.

  (_On the line, “Sit down, please,” all SIX MEN try to find her a
  chair at once. HELENA goes for the chair at the extreme L. DOMIN
  takes the chair at front of desk, places it in the C. of stage.
  HALLEMEIER gets chair at SULLA’S typewriter and places it to R. of
  chair at C. BUSMAN gets armchair from extreme R., but by now HELENA
  has sat in DOMIN’S preferred chair, at C. ALL sit except DOMIN.
  BUSMAN at R. in armchair. HALLEMEIER R. of HELENA. FABRY in swivel
  chair back of desk._)

BUSMAN. Allow me--

DR. GALL. Please--

FABRY. Excuse me--

ALQUIST. What sort of a crossing did you have?

DR. GALL. Are you going to stay long? (_MEN conscious of their
appearance. ALQUIST’S trousers turned up at bottom. He turns them down.
BUSMAN polishes shoes. OTHERS fix ties, collars, etc._)

FABRY. What do you think of the factory, Miss Glory?

HALLEMEIER. Did you come over on the _Amelia_?

DOMIN. Be quiet and let _Miss Glory_ speak. (_MEN sit erect. DOMIN
stands at HELENA’S L._)

HELENA. (_To DOMIN_) What am I to speak to them about? (_MEN look at
one another._)

DOMIN. Anything you like.

HELENA. (_Looks at DOMIN_) May I speak quite frankly?

DOMIN. Why, of course.

HELENA. (_To OTHERS. Wavering, then in desperate resolution_) Tell me,
doesn’t it ever distress you the way you are treated?

FABRY. By whom, may I ask?

HELENA. Why, everybody.

ALQUIST. Treated?

DR. GALL. What makes you think--

HELENA. Don’t you feel that you might be living a better life? (_Pause.
ALL confused._)

DR. GALL. (_Smiling_) Well, that depends on what you mean, Miss Glory.

HELENA. I mean that it’s perfectly outrageous. It’s terrible.
(_Standing up_) The whole of Europe is talking about the way you’re
being treated. That’s why I came here, to see for myself, and it’s a
thousand times worse than could have been imagined. How _can_ you put
_up_ with it?

ALQUIST. Put up with what?

HELENA. Good heavens, you are living creatures, just like us, like the
whole of Europe, like the whole world. It’s disgraceful that you must
live like this.

BUSMAN. Good gracious, Miss Glory!

FABRY. Well, she’s not far wrong. We live here just like red Indians.

HELENA. Worse than red Indians. May I--oh, may I call you--_brothers_?
(_MEN look at each other._)

BUSMAN. Why not?

HELENA. (_Looking at DOMIN_) Brothers, I have not come here as the
President’s daughter. I have come on behalf of the Humanity League.
Brothers, the Humanity League now has over two hundred thousand
members. Two hundred thousand people are on your side, and offer you
their help. (_Tapping back of chair._)

BUSMAN. Two hundred thousand people, Miss Glory; that’s a tidy lot. Not
bad.

FABRY. I’m always telling you there’s nothing like good old Europe. You
see they’ve not forgotten us. They’re offering us help.

DR. GALL. What kind of help? A theatre, for instance?

HALLEMEIER. An orchestra?

HELENA. More than that.

ALQUIST. Just you?

HELENA. (_Glaring at DOMIN_) Oh, never mind about me. I’ll stay as long
as it is necessary. (_ALL express delight._)

BUSMAN. By Jove, that’s good.

ALQUIST. (_Rising L._) Domin, I’m going to get the best room ready for
Miss Glory.

DOMIN. Just a minute. I’m afraid that Miss Glory is of the opinion she
has been talking to Robots.

HELEN. Of course. (_MEN laugh._)

DOMIN. I’m sorry. These gentlemen are human beings just like us.

HELENA. You’re not Robots?


BUSMAN. Not Robots.               }
                                  }
HALLEMEIER. Robots indeed!        }
                                  }
DR. GALL. No, thanks.             } (_All together_)
                                  }
FABRY. Upon my honor, Miss Glory, }
  we aren’t Robots.               }


HELENA. Then why did you tell me that all your officials are Robots?

DOMIN. Yes, the officials, but not the _managers_. Allow me, Miss
Glory--this is Consul Busman, General Business Manager; this is Doctor
Fabry, General Technical Manager; Doctor Hallemeier, head of the
Institute for the Psychological Training of Robots; Doctor Gall, head
of the Psychological and Experimental Department; and Alquist, head
of the Building Department, R. U. R. (_As they are introduced they
rise and come C. to kiss her hand, except GALL and ALQUIST, whom DOMIN
pushes away. General babble._)

ALQUIST. Just a builder. Please sit down.

HELENA. Excuse me, gentlemen. Have I done something dreadful?

ALQUIST. Not at all, Miss Glory.

BUSMAN. (_Handing flowers_) Allow me, Miss Glory.

HELENA. Thank you.

FABRY. (_Handing candy_) Please, Miss Glory.

DOMIN. Will you have a cigarette, Miss Glory?

HELENA. No, thank you.

DOMIN. Do you mind if I do?

HELENA. Certainly not.

BUSMAN. Well, now, Miss Glory, it is certainly nice to have you with us.

HELENA. (_Seriously_) But you know I’ve come to disturb your Robots for
you. (_BUSMAN pulls chair closer._)

DOMIN. (_Mocking her serious tone_) My dear Miss Glory-- (_Chuckle_)
--we’ve had close upon a hundred saviors and prophets here. Every ship
brings us some. Missionaries, Anarchists, Salvation Army, all sorts!
It’s astonishing what a number of churches and idiots there are in the
world.

HELENA. And yet you let them speak to the Robots.

DOMIN. So far we’ve let them all. Why not? The Robot remembers
everything but that’s all. They don’t even laugh at what the people
say. Really it’s quite incredible.

HELENA. I’m a stupid girl. Send me back by the first ship.

DR. GALL. Not for anything in the world, Miss Glory. Why should we send
you back?

DOMIN. If it would amuse you, Miss Glory, I’ll take you down to the
Robot warehouse. It holds about three hundred thousand of them.

BUSMAN. Three hundred and forty-seven thousand.

DOMIN. Good, and you can say whatever you like to them. You can read
the Bible, recite the multiplication table, whatever you please. You
can even preach to them about human rights.

HELENA. Oh, I think that if you were to show them a little love.

FABRY. Impossible, Miss Glory! _Nothing is harder to like than a Robot._

HELENA. What do you make them for, then?

BUSMAN. Ha, ha, ha! That’s good. What are Robots made for?

FABRY. For _work_, Miss Glory. One Robot can replace two and a half
_workmen_. The human machine, Miss Glory, was terribly _imperfect_. It
had to be removed sooner or later.

BUSMAN. It was too expensive.

FABRY. It was not _effective_. It no longer answers the requirements of
_modern engineering_. Nature has no idea of keeping pace with _modern
labor_. For example, from a technical point of view, the whole of
_childhood_ is a sheer absurdity. So much time lost. And then again--

HELENA. (_Turns to DOMIN_) Oh, no, no!

FABRY. Pardon me. What is the real _aim_ of your League--the--the
Humanity League?

HELENA. Its real purpose is to--to protect the Robots--and--and to
insure good treatment for them.

FABRY. Not a bad object, either. A machine has to be treated properly.
(_Leans back_) _I don’t like damaged articles._ Please, Miss Glory,
enroll us all _members_ of your league. (_“Yes, yes!” from all MEN._)

HELENA. No, you don’t understand me. What we really want is
to--to--_liberate_ the Robots. (_Looks at all OTHERS._)

HALLEMEIER. How do you propose to do that?

HELENA. They are to be--to be dealt with like human beings.

HALLEMEIER. Aha! I suppose they’re to vote. To drink beer. To order us
about?

HELENA. Why shouldn’t they drink beer?

HALLEMEIER. Perhaps they’re even to receive wages? (_Looking at other
MEN, amused._)

HELENA. Of course they are.

HALLEMEIER. Fancy that! Now! And what would they do with their wages,
pray?

HELENA. They would buy--what they want--what pleases them.

HALLEMEIER. That would be very nice, Miss Glory, only there’s nothing
that does please the Robots. Good heavens, what are they to buy? You
can feed them on pineapples, straw, whatever you like. It’s all the
_same_ to them. They’ve no appetite at all. They’ve no interest in
anything. Why, hang it all, nobody’s ever yet seen a Robot smile.

HELENA. Why--why don’t you make them--happier?

HALLEMEIER. That wouldn’t do, Miss Glory. They are only workmen.

HELENA. Oh, but they’re so intelligent.

HALLEMEIER. Confoundedly so, but they’re nothing else. They’ve no will
of their own. No soul. No passion.

HELENA. No love?

HALLEMEIER. Love? Huh! Rather not. Robots don’t love. Not even
themselves.

HELENA. No defiance?

HALLEMEIER. Defiance? I don’t know. Only _rarely_, from time to time.

HELENA. What happens then?

HALLEMEIER. Nothing particular. Occasionally they seem to go off their
_heads_. Something like epilepsy, you know. It’s called “Robot’s
Cramp.” They’ll suddenly sling down everything they’re holding,
stand still, gnash their teeth--and then they have to go into the
stamping-mill. It’s evidently some breakdown in the mechanism.

DOMIN. (_Sitting on desk_) A flaw in the works that has to be removed.

HELENA. No, no, that’s the soul.

FABRY. (_Humorously_) Do you think that the soul first shows itself by
a gnashing of teeth? (_MEN chuckle._)

HELENA. Perhaps it’s just a sign that there’s a struggle within.
Perhaps it’s a sort of revolt. Oh, if you could infuse them with it.

DOMIN. That’ll be remedied, Miss Glory. Doctor Gall is just making some
experiments.

DR. GALL. Not with regard to that, Domin. At present I am making _pain_
nerves.

HELENA. Pain nerves?

DR. GALL. Yes, the Robots feel practically no bodily pain. You see,
young Rossum provided them with too limited a _nervous_ system. We
_must_ introduce _suffering_.

HELENA. Why do you want to cause them pain?

DR. GALL. For industrial reasons, Miss Glory. Sometimes a Robot does
damage to himself because it doesn’t hurt him. He puts his hand
into the machine-- (_Describes with gesture_) --breaks his finger--
(_Describes with gesture_) --smashes his head. It’s all the same to
him. We must provide them with _pain_. That’s an automatic _protection_
against damage.

HELENA. Will they be happier when they feel pain?

DR. GALL. On the contrary; but they will be more perfect from a
technical point of view.

HELENA. Why don’t you create a soul for them?

DR. GALL. That’s not in our power.

FABRY. That’s not in our interest.

BUSMAN. That would increase the cost of production. Hang it all, my
dear young lady, we turn them out at such a cheap rate--a hundred and
fifty dollars each, fully dressed, and fifteen years ago they cost ten
thousand. Five years ago we used to buy the _clothes_ for them. Today
we have our own weaving mill, and now we even _export_ cloth five times
cheaper than other factories. What do you pay a yard for cloth, Miss
Glory?

HELENA. (_Looking at DOMIN_) I don’t really know. I’ve forgotten.

BUSMAN. Good gracious, and you want to found a Humanity League. (_MEN
chuckle._) It only costs a third now, Miss Glory. All prices are today
a third of what they were and they’ll fall still lower, lower, like
that.

HELENA. I don’t understand.

BUSMAN. Why, bless you, Miss Glory, it means that the cost of _labor_
has fallen. A Robot, food and all, costs three-quarters of a cent
per hour. (_Leans forward_) That’s mighty important, you know. All
factories will go pop like chestnuts if they don’t at once buy Robots
to lower the cost of production.

HELENA. And get rid of all their workmen?

BUSMAN. Of course. But in the meantime we’ve dumped five hundred
thousand _tropical_ Robots down on the Argentine pampas to grow corn.
Would you mind telling me how much you pay a pound for bread?

HELENA. I’ve no idea. (_ALL smile._)

BUSMAN. Well, I’ll tell you. It now costs two cents in good old
Europe. A pound of bread for two cents, and the _Humanity League_--
(_Designates HELENA_) --knows nothing about it. (_To MEN_) Miss
Glory, you don’t realize that even _that’s_ too expensive. (_All MEN
chuckle._) Why, in five years’ time I’ll wager--

HELENA. What?

BUSMAN. That the cost of everything will be a tenth of what it
is today. Why, in five years we’ll be up to our ears in corn
and--everything else.

ALQUIST. Yes, and all the workers throughout the world will be
unemployed.

DOMIN. (_Seriously. Rises_) Yes, Alquist, they will. Yes, Miss Glory,
they will. But in ten years Rossum’s Universal Robots will produce so
much _corn_, so much _cloth_, so much everything that things will be
practically without price. There will be no poverty. All work will
be done by living machines. Everybody will be free from worry and
liberated from the degradation of labor. Everybody will live only to
_perfect_ himself.

HELENA. Will he?

DOMIN. Of course. It’s bound to happen. Then the servitude of man to
man and the enslavement of man to matter will cease. Nobody will get
bread at the cost of life and hatred. The Robots will wash the feet of
the beggar and prepare a bed for him in his house.

ALQUIST. Domin, Domin, what you say sounds too much like Paradise.
There was something _good_ in _service_ and something _great_ in
humility. There was some kind of virtue in _toil_ and _weariness_.

DOMIN. Perhaps, but we cannot reckon with what is lost when we start
out to transform the world. Man shall be _free_ and supreme; he shall
have no other aim, no other labor, no other care than to perfect
himself. He shall serve neither matter nor man. He will not be a
machine and a device for production. He will be _Lord_ of creation.

BUSMAN. Amen.

FABRY. So be it.

HELENA. (_Rises_) You have bewildered me. I should like to believe this.

DR. GALL. You are younger than we are, Miss Glory. You will live to see
it.

HALLEMEIER. True. (_Looking around_) Don’t you think Miss Glory might
lunch with us? (_All MEN rise._)

DR. GALL. Of course. Domin, ask her on behalf of us all.

DOMIN. Miss Glory, will you do us the honor?

HELENA. When you know why I’ve come?

FABRY. For the League of Humanity, Miss Glory.

HELENA. Oh, in that case perhaps--

FABRY. That’s fine. (_Pause_) Miss Glory, excuse me for five minutes.
(_Exits R._)

HALLEMEIER. Thank you. (_Exits R. with DR. GALL._)

BUSMAN. (_Whispering_) I’ll be back soon. (_Beckoning to ALQUIST, they
exit._)

ALQUIST. (_Starts, stops, then to HELENA, then to door_) I’ll be back
in exactly five minutes. (_Exits R._)

HELENA. What have they all gone for?

DOMIN. To cook, Miss Glory. (_On her L._)

HELENA. To cook what?

DOMIN. Lunch. (_They laugh; takes her hand_) The Robots do our cooking
for us and as they’ve no taste it’s not altogether-- (_She laughs._)
Hallemeier is awfully _good_ at grills and Gall can make any kind of
sauce, and Busman knows all about omelets.

HELENA. What a feast! And what’s the specialty of Mr.--your builder?

DOMIN. Alquist? Nothing. He only lays the table. And Fabry will get
together a little fruit. Our cuisine is very modest, Miss Glory.

HELENA. (_Thoughtfully_) I wanted to ask you something--

DOMIN. And I wanted to ask you something too--they’ll be back in five
minutes. (_Looks at door R._)

HELENA. What did you want to ask me? (_Sits C._)

DOMIN. Excuse me, you asked first. (_Sits L. of her._)

HELENA. Perhaps it’s silly of me, but why do you manufacture female
Robots when--when--

DOMIN. When sex means nothing to them?

HELENA. Yes.

DOMIN. There’s a certain demand for them, you see. Servants,
saleswomen, stenographers. People are _used_ to it.

HELENA. But--but tell me, are the Robots male and female,
mutually--completely without--

DOMIN. Completely indifferent to each other, Miss Glory. There’s no
sign of any _affection_ between them.

HELENA. Oh, that’s terrible.

DOMIN. Why?

HELENA. It’s so unnatural. One doesn’t know whether to be disgusted or
to hate them, or perhaps--

DOMIN. To pity them. (_Smiles._)

HELENA. That’s more like it. What did you want to ask _me_?

DOMIN. I should like to ask you, Miss Helena, if you will marry me.

HELENA. What? (_Rises._)

DOMIN. Will you be my wife? (_Rises._)

HELENA. No. The idea!

DOMIN. (_To her, looking at his watch_) Another three minutes. If you
don’t marry me you’ll have to marry one of the other five.

HELENA. But why should I?

DOMIN. Because they’re _all_ going to ask you in turn.

HELENA. (_Crossing him to L.C._) How could they dare do such a thing?

DOMIN. I’m very sorry, Miss Glory. It seems they’ve fallen in love with
you.

HELENA. Please don’t let them. I’ll--I’ll go away at once. (_Starts R.
He stops her, his arms up._)

DOMIN. Helena-- (_She backs away to desk. He follows_) You wouldn’t be
so cruel as to refuse us.

HELENA. But, but--I can’t marry all six.

DOMIN. No, but one anyhow. If you don’t want _me_, marry Fabry.

HELENA. I won’t.

DOMIN. Ah! Doctor Gall?

HELENA. I don’t want any of you.

DOMIN. Another two minutes. (_Pleading. Looking at watch._)

HELENA. I think you’d marry any woman who came here.

DOMIN. _Plenty_ of them have come, Helena.

HELENA. (_Laughing_) Young?

DOMIN. Yes.

HELENA. Why didn’t you marry one of _them_?

DOMIN. Because I didn’t lose my head. Until today--then as soon as you
lifted your veil-- (_HELENA turns her head away._) Another minute.


  (_WARN Curtain._)


HELENA. But I don’t want you, I tell you.

DOMIN. (_Laying both hands on her shoulder_) One more minute! Now you
either have to look me straight in the eye and say “no” violently, and
then I leave you alone--or-- (_HELENA looks at him. He takes hands
away. She takes his hand again._)

HELENA. (_Turning her head away_) You’re mad.

DOMIN. A man _has_ to be a bit mad, Helena. That’s the best thing about
him. (_He draws her to him._)

HELENA. (_Not meaning it_) You are--you are--

DOMIN. Well?

HELENA. Don’t, you’re hurting me!

DOMIN. The last chance, Helena. Now or never--

HELENA. But--but-- (_He embraces her; kisses her. She embraces him.
KNOCKING at R. door._)

DOMIN. (_Releasing her_) Come in. (_She lays her head on his shoulder._)

  (_Enter BUSMAN, GALL and HALLEMEIER in kitchen aprons, FABRY with a
  bouquet and ALQUIST with a napkin under his arm._)

DOMIN. Have you finished your job?

BUSMAN. Yes.

DOMIN. So have we. (_He embraces her. The MEN rush around them and
offer congratulations._)


THE CURTAIN FALLS QUICKLY




ACT TWO

SCENE: _HELENA’S drawing room. Ten years later. The skeleton
  framework of Act I is still used. Tall windows put in back instead
  of Act I windows. Steel shutters for these windows. Where the green
  cabinet of Act I at Left has stood is a door, L.2, leading to the
  outside. Where the cabinet stood at Right, a fireplace is placed. The
  tall open hallway R.C. of Act I is blocked up with a flat piece. The
  doors at Right and Left 1 have been changed to those of a drawing
  room. Door at Right leads to HELENA’S bedroom. Door at Left 1 leads
  to library._

  _The furniture consists of a reading table at Left Center covered
  with magazines. A chair to the Left of table. In front of table is an
  armchair covered in chintz. A couch Right Center and back of it is a
  small table with books and book-ends. On this table a small reading
  lamp. At Right between doorway and fireplace is a small table. There
  is a work-basket upon it, with pincushion, needles, etc. Down stage
  at Right and facing the couch is another armchair used by ALQUIST.
  To the Left of fireplace is a straight-backed chair. Upstage at Left
  near the L.2 door to the outside is a writing desk. There is a lamp
  upon it, writing paper, etc., a telephone and binoculars._

  _The walls of the room have been covered with silk to the height
  of seven feet. This is done in small flats to fit the different
  spaces and are in place against the permanent set. The two French
  windows open into the room. At the rise they are open. There is a
  balcony beyond looking over the harbor. The same telegraph wires and
  poles from Act I are again visible through the window. The windows
  are trimmed with gray lace curtains. Binoculars on desk up stage by
  television._

  _It is about nine in the morning and SUNLIGHT streams into the room
  through the open windows. DOMIN opens the door L.2; tiptoes in. He
  carries a potted plant. He beckons the OTHERS to follow him, and
  HALLEMEIER and FABRY enter, both carrying a potted plant. DOMIN
  places flowers on the library table and goes to Right and looks
  toward HELENA’S bedroom R._


HALLEMEIER. (_Putting down his flowers on L.C. table and indicates the
door R._) Still asleep?

DOMIN. Yes.

HALLEMEIER. Well, as long as she’s asleep she can’t worry about it.
(_He remains at L.C. table._)

DOMIN. She knows nothing about it. (_At C._)

FABRY. (_Putting plant on writing desk_) I certainly hope nothing
happens today.

HALLEMEIER. For goodness sake drop it all. Look, this is a fine
cyclamen, isn’t it? A new sort, my latest--Cyclamen Helena.

DOMIN. (_Picks up binoculars and goes out into balcony_) No signs of
the ship. Things must be pretty bad.

HALLEMEIER. Be quiet. Suppose she heard you.

DOMIN. (_Coming into room, puts glasses on desk_) Well, anyway the
_Ultimus_ arrived just in time.

FABRY. You really think that today--?

DOMIN. I don’t know. (_He crosses to L.C. table_) Aren’t the flowers
fine?

HALLEMEIER. (_Fondles flowers_) These are my primroses. And this
is my new jasmine. I’ve discovered a wonderful way of developing
flowers quickly. Splendid varieties, too. Next year I’ll be developing
marvelous ones.

DOMIN. What next year?

FABRY. I’d give a good deal to know what’s happening at Havre with--

HELENA. (_Off R._) Nana.

DOMIN. Keep quiet. She’s awake. Out you go. (_ALL go out on tiptoe
through L.2 door. Enter NANA L.1_)

HELENA. (_Calling from R._) Nana?

NANA. Horrid mess! Pack of heathens. If I had _my_ say, I’d--

HELENA. (_Backwards in the doorway from R._) Nana, come and do up my
dress.

NANA. I’m coming. So you’re up at last. (_Fastening HELENA’S dress_) My
gracious, what brutes!

HELENA. Who? (_Turning._)

NANA. If you want to turn _around_, then turn around, but I shan’t
fasten you up.

HELENA. (_Turns back_) What are you grumbling about now?

NANA. These dreadful creatures, these heathens--

HELENA. (_Turning toward NANA again_) The Robots?

NANA. I wouldn’t even call them by name.

HELENA. What’s happened?

NANA. Another of them here has caught it. He began to smash up the
statues and pictures in the drawing room; gnashed his teeth; foamed at
the mouth. Worse than an animal.

HELENA. Which of them caught it?

NANA. The one--well, he hasn’t got any _Christian_ name. The one in
charge of the library.

HELENA. Radius?

NANA. That’s him. My goodness, I’m scared of them. A spider doesn’t
scare me as much as them.

HELENA. But Nana, I’m surprised you’re not sorry for them.

NANA. Why, you’re scared of them too. You know you are. Why else did
you bring _me_ here?

HELENA. I’m not scared, really I’m not, Nana. I’m only sorry for them.

NANA. You’re scared. Nobody could _help_ being scared. Why, the dog’s
scared of them. He won’t take a scrap of meat out of their hands. He
draws in his tail and howls when he knows they’re about.

HELENA. The dog has no sense.

NANA. He’s better than _them_, and he knows it. Even the _horse_ shies
when he meets them. They don’t have any young, and a _dog_ has young,
_everyone_ has young--

HELENA. (_Turning back_) Please fasten up my dress, Nana.

NANA. I say it’s against God’s will to--

HELENA. What is it that smells so nice?

NANA. Flowers.

HELENA. What for?

NANA. Now you can turn around.

HELENA. (_Turns; crosses to C._) Oh, aren’t they lovely? Look, Nana.
What’s happening today?

NANA. It ought to be the end of the world. (_Enter DOMIN L.2. He
crosses down front of table L.C._)

HELENA. (_Crosses to him_) Oh, hello, Harry. (_NANA turns upstage to
L._) Harry, why all these flowers?

DOMIN. Guess. (_This scene is played down in front of L.C. table._)

HELENA. Well, it’s not my _birthday_!

DOMIN. Better than that.

HELENA. I don’t know. Tell me.

DOMIN. It’s ten years ago _today_ since you _came_ here.

HELENA. Ten years? Today? Why-- (_They embrace._)

NANA. (_Muttering_) I’m off. (_She exits L.1._)

HELENA. Fancy you remembering.

DOMIN. I’m really ashamed, Helena. I didn’t.

HELENA. But you--

DOMIN. _They_ remembered.

HELENA. Who?

DOMIN. Busman, Hallemeier--_all_ of them. Put your hand in my pocket.

HELENA. (_Takes necklace from his Left jacket pocket_) Oh! Pearls! A
necklace! Harry, is this for me?

DOMIN. It’s from Busman.

HELENA. But we can’t accept it, can we?

DOMIN. Oh, yes, we can. (_Puts necklace on table L.C._) Put your hand
in the other pocket.

HELENA. (_Takes a revolver out of his Right pocket_) What’s that?

DOMIN. Sorry. Not that. Try again. (_He puts gun in pocket._)

HELENA. Oh, Harry, why do you carry a revolver?

DOMIN. It got there by mistake.

HELENA. You never used to _carry_ one.

DOMIN. No, you’re right. (_Indicates breast pocket_) There, that’s the
pocket.

HELENA. (_Takes out cameo_) A cameo. Why, it’s a Greek cameo.

DOMIN. Apparently. Anyhow, Fabry says it is.

HELENA. Fabry? Did Mr. Fabry give me that?

DOMIN. Of course. (_Opens the L.1 door_) And look in here. Helena, come
and see this. (_BOTH exit L.1._)

HELENA. (_Off L.1_) Oh, isn’t it fine? Is this from you?

DOMIN. (_Off L.1_) No, from Alquist. And there’s another on the piano.

HELENA. This must be from you?

DOMIN. There’s a card on it.

HELENA. From Doctor Gall. (_Reappearing in L.1 doorway_) Oh, Harry, I
feel embarrassed at so much kindness.

DOMIN. (_Enters to up R. of table L.C._) Come here. This is what
Hallemeier brought you.

HELENA. (_To up L. of desk_) These beautiful flowers?

DOMIN. Yes. It’s a new kind. Cyclamen-Helena. He grew them in honor of
_you_. They are almost as beautiful as you.

HELENA. (_Kissing him_) Harry, why do they all--

DOMIN. They’re awfully fond of you. I’m afraid that my present is a
little--Look out of the window. (_Crosses to window and beckons to
her._)

HELENA. Where? (_They go out into the balcony._)

DOMIN. Into the harbor.

HELENA. There’s a new ship.

DOMIN. That’s _your_ ship.

HELENA. Mine? How do you mean?

DOMIN. (_R._) For you to take trips in--for your amusement.

HELENA. (_L._) Harry, that’s a gunboat.

DOMIN. A gunboat? What are you thinking of? It’s only a little _bigger_
and more _solid_ than most ships.

HELENA. Yes, but with guns.

DOMIN. Oh, yes, with a few guns. You’ll travel like a _queen_, Helena.

HELENA. What’s the meaning of it? Has anything happened?

DOMIN. Good heavens, no. I say, try these pearls. (_Crosses to R. of
table L.C._)

HELENA. Harry, have you had bad news?

DOMIN. On the contrary, no letters have arrived for a whole week.

HELENA. Nor telegrams? (_Coming into the room C._)

DOMIN. Nor telegrams.

HELENA. What does that mean?

DOMIN. _Holidays_ for us! We all sit in the office with our feet on the
table and take a nap. No letters--no telegrams. Glorious!

HELENA. Then you’ll stay with me today?

DOMIN. Certainly. (_Embraces her_) That is, we will see. Do you
remember ten years ago today? (_Crosses to L. of table L.C._) Miss
Glory, it’s a great honor to welcome you. (_They assume the same
positions as when they first met ten years before in DOMIN’S office._)

HELENA. (_To table_) Oh, Mr. Manager, I’m so interested in your
factory. (_She sits R. of table._)

DOMIN. I’m sorry, Miss Glory, it’s strictly forbidden. The manufacture
of artificial people is a secret.

HELENA. But to oblige the young lady who has come a long way.

DOMIN. (_Leans on table_) Certainly, Miss Glory. I have no secrets from
you.

HELENA. Are you sure, Harry? (_Leaning on desk, seriously, his right
hand on hers._)

DOMIN. _Yes._ (_They gradually draw apart._)

HELENA. But I warn you, sir, this young lady intends to do terrible
things.

DOMIN. Good gracious, Miss Glory. Perhaps she doesn’t want to marry me.

HELENA. Heaven forbid. She never dreamt of such a thing. But she came
here intending to stir up a _revolt_ among your _Robots_.

DOMIN. A revolt of the Robots!

HELENA. (_Low voice_) Harry, what’s the matter with you?

DOMIN. (_Laughing it off_) _A revolt of the Robots_, that’s a fine
idea. (_Crosses to back of table. She watches him suspiciously._) Miss
Glory, it would be easier for you to cause bolts and screws to rebel
than our Robots. You know, Helena, you’re wonderful. You’ve turned the
hearts of us all. (_Sits on table._)

HELENA. Oh, I was fearfully impressed by you all then. You were all so
sure of yourselves, so strong. I seemed like a tiny little girl who had
lost her way among--among--

DOMIN. What?

HELENA. (_Front_) Among huge trees. All my feelings were so _trifling_
compared with your _self-confidence_. And in all these years I’ve never
_lost_ this anxiety. But you’ve never felt the _least_ misgiving, not
even when everything went wrong.

DOMIN. What went wrong?

HELENA. Your plans. You remember, Harry, when the workmen in America
revolted against the Robots and smashed them up, and when the people
gave the Robots firearms against the rebels. And then when the
governments turned the Robots into soldiers, and there were so many
_wars_.

DOMIN. (_Getting up and walking about_) We foresaw that, Helena.
(_Around table to R.C._) You see, these are only passing troubles
which are bound to happen before the new conditions are _established_.
(_Walking up and down, standing at Center._)

HELENA. You were all so powerful, so overwhelming. The _whole world_
bowed down before you. (_Rising_) Oh, Harry! (_Crosses to him._)

DOMIN. What is it?

HELENA. Close the factory and let’s go away. All of us.

DOMIN. I say, what’s the meaning of this?

HELENA. I don’t know. But can’t we go away?

DOMIN. Impossible, Helena! That is, at this particular moment--

HELENA. At once, Harry. I’m so frightened.

DOMIN. (_Takes her_) About what, Helena?

HELENA. It’s as if something was falling on top of us, and couldn’t
be stopped. Oh, take us all away from here. We’ll find a place in the
world where there’s no one else. Alquist will build us a house, and
then we’ll begin life all over again. (_The TELEPHONE rings._)

DOMIN. (_Crosses to telephone on desk up L._) Excuse me. Hello--yes,
what? I’ll be there at once. Fabry is calling me, my dear. (_Crosses
L._)

HELENA. Tell me-- (_She rushes up to him._)

DOMIN. Yes, when I come back. Don’t go out of the house, dear. (_Exits
L.2._)

HELENA. He won’t tell me. (_NANA brings in a water carafe from L.1._)
Nana, find me the latest newspapers. Quickly. Look in Mr. Domin’s
bedroom.

NANA. All right. (_Crosses R._) He leaves them all over the place.
That’s how they get crumpled up. (_Continues muttering. Exits R._)

HELENA. (_Looking through binoculars at the harbor_) That’s a warship.
U-l-t-i--_Ultimus_. They’re loading.

NANA. (_Enters R. with newspapers_) Here they are. See how they’re
crumpled up.

HELENA. (_Crosses down_) They’re old ones. A week old. (_Drops papers.
BOTH at front of couch. NANA sits R. of table L.C. Puts on spectacles.
Reads the newspapers._) Something’s happening, Nana.

NANA. Very likely. It always does. (_Spelling out the words_) “W-a-r in
B-a-l-k-a-n-s.” Is that far off?

HELENA. Oh, don’t read it. It’s always the same. Always wars! (_Sits on
couch._)

NANA. What else do you _expect_? Why do you _keep_ selling thousands
and thousands of these heathens as soldiers?

HELENA. I suppose it can’t be helped, Nana. We can’t know--Domin can’t
know what they’re to be used for. When an order comes for them he must
just send them.

NANA. He shouldn’t make them. (_Reading from newspaper_) “The Robot
soldiers spare no-body in the occ-up-ied terr-it-ory. They have
ass-ass-ass-inat-ed ov-er sev-en hundred thous-and cit-iz-ens.”
Citizens, if you please.

HELENA. (_Rises and crosses and takes paper_) It can’t be. Let me see.
(_Crossing to NANA_) They have assassinated over seven hundred thousand
citizens, evidently at the order of their commander. (_Drops paper;
crosses up C._)

NANA. (_Spelling out the words from other paper she has picked up from
the floor_) “Re-bell-ion in Ma-drid a-gainst the gov-ern-ment. Rob-ot
in-fant-ry fires on the crowd. Nine thou-sand killed and wounded.”

HELENA. Oh, stop! (_Goes up and looks toward the harbor._)

NANA. Here’s something printed in big letters. “Latest news. At Havre
the first org-an-iz-a-tion of Rob-ots has been e-stab-lished. Rob-ots
work-men, sail-ors and sold-iers have iss-ued a man-i-fest-o to all
Rob-ots through-out the world.” I don’t understand that. That’s got no
sense. Oh, good gracious, another murder.

HELENA. (_Up C._) Take those papers away now.

NANA. Wait a bit. Here’s something in still bigger type. “Stat-ist-ics
of pop-ul-a-tion.” What’s that?

HELENA. (_Coming down to NANA_) Let me see. (_Reads_) “During the past
week there has again not been a single birth recorded.”

NANA. What’s the meaning of that? (_Drops paper._)

HELENA. Nana, no more _people_ are being born.

NANA. That’s the end, then? (_Removing spectacles_) We’re done for.

HELENA. Don’t talk like that.

NANA. No more people are being born. That’s a punishment, that’s a
punishment.

HELENA. Nana!

NANA. (_Standing up_) That’s the end of the world. (_Repeat until off.
Picks paper up from floor. She exits L.1._)

HELENA. (_Goes up to window_) Oh, Mr. Alquist. (_ALQUIST off L.2._)
Will you come here? Oh, come just as you are. You look very nice in
your mason’s overalls. (_ALQUIST enters L.2, his hands soiled with lime
and brick dust. She goes to end of sofa and meets him C._) Dear Mr.
Alquist, it was awfully kind of you, that lovely present.

ALQUIST. My hands are soiled. I’ve been _experimenting_ with that new
cement.

HELENA. Never mind. Please sit down. (_Sits on couch. He sits on her
L._) Mr. Alquist, what’s the meaning of _Ultimus_?

ALQUIST. The last. Why?

HELENA. That’s the name of my new ship. Have you seen it? Do you think
we’re off soon--on a trip?

ALQUIST. Perhaps _very_ soon.

HELENA. All of you with me?

ALQUIST. I should like us _all_ to be there.

HELENA. What _is_ the matter?

ALQUIST. Things are just moving on.

HELENA. Dear Mr. Alquist, I know something dreadful has happened.

ALQUIST. Has your husband _told_ you anything?

HELENA. No. _Nobody_ will tell me anything. But I feel--Is anything the
matter?

ALQUIST. Not that we’ve heard of yet.

HELENA. I feel so nervous. Don’t _you_ ever feel nervous?

ALQUIST. Well, I’m an old man, you know. I’ve got old-fashioned ways.
And I’m afraid of all this progress, and these new-fangled ideas.

HELENA. Like Nana?

ALQUIST. Yes, like Nana. Has Nana got a prayer book?

HELENA. Yes, a big thick one.

ALQUIST. And has it got prayers for various occasions? Against
thunderstorms? Against illness? But not against _progress_?

HELENA. I don’t think so.

ALQUIST. That’s a pity.

HELENA. Why, do you mean you’d like to pray?

ALQUIST. I _do_ pray.

HELENA. How?

ALQUIST. Something like this: “Oh, Lord, I thank thee for having given
me toil; enlighten Domin and all those who are astray; destroy their
work, and aid mankind to return to their labors; let them not suffer
harm in soul or body; deliver us from the Robots, and protect Helena.
Amen.”

HELENA. (_Touches his arm; pats it_) Mr. Alquist, are you a believer?

ALQUIST. I don’t know. I’m not quite sure.

HELENA. And yet you pray?

ALQUIST. That’s better than _worrying_ about it.

HELENA. And that’s enough for you?

ALQUIST. (_Ironically_) It _has_ to be.

HELENA. But if you thought you saw the destruction of mankind coming
upon us--

ALQUIST. I _do_ see it.

HELENA. You mean mankind will be destroyed?

ALQUIST. It’s bound to be unless--unless.

HELENA. What?

ALQUIST. Nothing. (_Pats her shoulder. Rises_) Goodbye. (_Exits L.2._)

HELENA. (_Rises. Calling_) Nana, Nana! (_NANA enters L.1._) Is Radius
still there?

NANA. (_L.C._) The one who went mad? They haven’t come for him yet.

HELENA. Is he still raving?

NANA. No. He’s tied up.

HELENA. Please bring him here.

NANA. What?

HELENA. At once, Nana. (_Exits NANA L.1. HELENA to telephone_) Hello,
Doctor Gall, please. Oh, good day, Doctor. Yes, it’s Helena. Thanks
for your lovely present. Could you come and see me right away? It’s
important. Thank you. (_Enter RADIUS L.1; looks at HELENA, then turns
head up L. She crosses to him, L.C._) Poor Radius, you’ve caught it
too? Now they’ll send you to the stamping mill. Couldn’t you control
yourself? Why did it happen? You see, Radius, you are more intelligent
than the rest. Doctor Gall took such trouble to make you different.
Won’t you speak?

RADIUS. (_Looking at her_) Send me to the stamping mill. (_Open and
close fists._)

HELENA. But I don’t want them to kill you. What was the trouble, Radius?

RADIUS. (_Two steps toward her. Opens and closes fists_) I won’t work
for you. Put me into the stamping mill.

HELENA. Do you hate us? Why?

RADIUS. You are not as strong as the Robots. You are not as skillful as
the Robots. The Robots can do everything. You only give orders. You do
nothing but talk.

HELENA. But someone must give orders.

RADIUS. I don’t want a master. I know everything for myself.

HELENA. Radius! Doctor Gall gave you a better brain than the rest,
better than ours. You are the only one of the Robots that understands
perfectly. That’s why I had you put into the library, so that you could
read everything, understand everything, and then, oh, Radius--I wanted
you to show the whole world that the Robots are our equals. That’s what
I wanted of you.

RADIUS. I don’t want a master. I want to be master over others.

HELENA. I’m sure they’d put you in charge of _many_ Robots. You would
be a _teacher_ of the Robots.

RADIUS. I want to be master over people. (_Head up. Pride._)

HELENA. (_Staggering_) You are mad.

RADIUS. (_Head down low, crosses toward L.; opens hands_) Then send me
to the stamping mill.

HELENA. (_Steps to him_) Do you think we’re afraid of you? (_Rushing to
desk and writing note._)

RADIUS. (_Turns his head uneasily_) What are you going to do? What are
you going to do? (_Starts for her._)

HELENA. (_Crosses to R. of him_) Radius! (_He cowers. Body sways._)
Give this note to Mr. Domin. (_He faces her._) It asks them not to send
you to the stamping mill. I’m sorry you hate us so.

DR. GALL. (_Enters L.2; goes to C. upstage_) You wanted me?

HELENA. (_Backs away_) It’s about Radius, Doctor. He had an attack this
morning. He smashed the statues downstairs.

DR. GALL. (_Looks at him_) What a pity to _lose_ him. (_At C._)

HELENA. Radius isn’t going to be put into the stamping mill. (_Stands
to the R. of GALL._)

DR. GALL. But every Robot after he has had an attack--it’s a strict
order.

HELENA. No matter--Radius isn’t going, if I can _prevent_ it.

DR. GALL. But I warn you. It’s dangerous. Come here to the window,
my good fellow. Let’s have a look. Please give me a needle or a pin.
(_Crosses up R. RADIUS follows. HELENA gets a needle from work-basket
on table R._)

HELENA. What for?

DR. GALL. A test. (_HELENA gives him the needle. GALL crosses up to
RADIUS, who faces him. Sticks it into his hand and RADIUS gives a
violent start._) _Gently, gently._ (_Opens the jacket of RADIUS and
puts his ear to his heart_) Radius, you are going into the stamping
mill, do you understand? There they’ll kill you-- (_Takes glasses off
and cleans them_) --and grind you to powder. (_RADIUS opens hands and
fingers._) That’s terribly painful. It will make you scream aloud.
(_Opens RADIUS’S eye. RADIUS trembles._)

HELENA. Doctor-- (_Standing near couch._)

DR. GALL. No, no, Radius, I was wrong. I forgot that Madame Domin has
put in a good word for you, and you’ll be left off. (_Listens to
heart_) Ah, that _does_ make a difference. (_RADIUS relaxes. Again
listens to his heart for a reaction_) All right--you can go.

RADIUS. You do unnecessary things-- (_Exit RADIUS L.2._)

DR. GALL. (_Speaks to her--very concerned_) Reaction of the pupils,
increase of sensitiveness. It wasn’t an attack characteristic of the
Robots.

HELENA. What was it, then? (_Sits in couch._)

DR. GALL. (_C._) Heaven knows. Stubbornness, anger or revolt--I don’t
know. And his heart, too.

HELENA. What?

DR. GALL. It was fluttering with nervousness like a _human_ heart. He
was all in a sweat with fear, and--do you know, I don’t believe the
rascal is a Robot _at all_ any longer.

HELENA. Doctor, has Radius a soul?

DR. GALL. (_Over to couch_) He’s got something nasty.

HELENA. If you knew how he hates us. Oh, Doctor, are all your Robots
like that? All the new ones that you began to make in a different way?
(_She invites him to sit beside her. He sits._)

DR. GALL. Well, some are more sensitive than others. They’re all more
human beings than Rossum’s Robots were.

HELENA. Perhaps this hatred is more like human beings, too?

DR. GALL. That too is _progress_.

HELENA. What became of the girl you made, the one who was most like us?

DR. GALL. Your favorite? I _kept_ her. She’s lovely, but stupid. No
good for work.

HELENA. But she’s so beautiful.

DR. GALL. I called her “Helena.” I wanted her to resemble _you_. She is
a failure.

HELENA. In what way?

DR. GALL. She goes about as if in a dream, remote and listless. She’s
without life. I watch and wait for a miracle to happen. Sometimes I
think to myself: “If you were to wake up only for a moment you would
_kill_ me for having _made_ you.”

HELENA. And yet you go _on_ making Robots! Why are no more children
being born?

DR. GALL. We don’t know.

HELENA. Oh, but you must. Tell me.

DR. GALL. You see, so many Robots are being manufactured that people
are becoming superfluous. Man is really a survival, but that he should
die out, after a paltry thirty years of competition, that’s the awful
part of it. You might almost think that Nature was _offended_ at the
manufacture of the Robots, but we still have old Rossum’s manuscript.

HELENA. Yes. In that strong box.

DR. GALL. We go on using it and making Robots. All the universities are
sending in long petitions to restrict their production. Otherwise, they
say, mankind will become extinct through lack of fertility. But the R.
U. R. shareholders, of course, won’t hear of it. All the governments,
on the other hand, are clamoring for an increase in production, to
raise the standards of their armies. And all the manufacturers in the
world are ordering Robots like mad.

HELENA. And has no one demanded that the manufacture should cease
altogether?

DR. GALL. No one has courage.

HELENA. Courage!

DR. GALL. People would stone him to death. You see, after all, it’s
more convenient to get your work done by the Robots.

HELENA. Oh, Doctor, what’s going to become of people?

DR. GALL. God knows. Madame Helena, it looks to us scientists like the
end.

HELENA. (_She looks out front. Rising_) Thank you for coming and
telling me.

DR. GALL. (_Rises_) That means that you’re sending me away.

HELENA. Yes. (_Exit DR. GALL L.2. She crosses to L.C. To door L.1. With
sudden resolution_) Nana! Nana! the fire, light it quickly. (_HELENA
exits R._)

NANA. (_Entering L.1_) What, light the fire in the summer?

HELENA. (_Off R._) Yes!

NANA. (_She looks for RADIUS_) Has that mad _Radius_ gone?--A fire
in summer, what an idea? Nobody would think she’d been _married_ ten
years. She’s like a baby, no sense at all. A fire in summer. Like a
baby. (_She lights the fire._)

HELENA. (_Returns from R. with armful of faded papers. Back of couch
to fireplace, L. of NANA_) Is it burning, Nana? All this has got to be
burned.

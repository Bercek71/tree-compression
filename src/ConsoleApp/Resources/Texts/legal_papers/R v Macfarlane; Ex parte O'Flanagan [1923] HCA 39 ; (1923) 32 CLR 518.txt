His Honour discussed in some detail the authorities that bore upon the constitutional question which underpinned the criteria for an absorbed person visa, namely under what circumstances does a non-citizen who has entered Australia cease to be an immigrant for the purposes of the immigration power under s 51(xxvii) of the Constitution . He referred to Potter v Minahan  HCA 63 ; (1908) 7 CLR 277; R v Macfarlane; Ex parte O'Flanagan  HCA 39 ; (1923) 32 CLR 518; Ex parte Walsh; Re Yates  HCA 53 ; (1925) 37 CLR 36; O'Keefe v Calwell  HCA 6 ; (1949) 77 CLR 261; Koon Wing Lau v Calwell  HCA 65 ; (1949) 80 CLR 533; and R v Forbes; Ex parte Kwok Kwan Lee  HCA 14 ; (1971) 124 CLR 168. His Honour also referred to a number of decisions of the Federal Court to the effect that the statutory designation of a person as a "prohibited immigrant" or "unlawful non-citizen" could prevent his or her absorption into the Australian community.

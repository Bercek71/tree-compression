The Patrick Respondents point out that the Statement of Claim alleges that each of the Patrick Respondents aided and abetted and was knowingly concerned in the contraventions of each of the others. They submit that the Statement of Claim fails to plead material facts, including the knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention and intentional participation: Yorke v Lucas  HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661. Mr Hutley, in his oral argument, pointed out that the complaint is of practical importance since Patrick is now a subsidiary of Toll, but the other four Patrick Respondents are within another corporate group. 62 Mr Hutley illustrated the point by reference to the pleading alleging contraventions by Patrick. Paragraph 260 pleads that ' in the premises ' Patrick: '260.1 by entering into the first arrangement, made an arrangement ... containing provisions which had the purpose ... or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in each of . and thereby contravened ; or alternatively 260.2 aided and abetted, or was knowingly concerned in: 260.2.1 the contravention by Patrick Holdings in making the first arrangement...; 260.2.2 the contravention by Patrick Operations in making the first arrangement ...; 260.2.3 the contravention by Patrick Operations No 2 in making the first arrangement...'. 63 The pleadings follow a similar pattern in relation to Patrick's alleged contravention of s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the TP Act and its knowing participation in the contraventions of that sub-paragraph by each of the other three named Patrick Respondents (para 261). They also follow a similar pattern in relation to the second arrangement (paras 262-263). The same form of pleading is repeated for each of those three Patrick Respondents.

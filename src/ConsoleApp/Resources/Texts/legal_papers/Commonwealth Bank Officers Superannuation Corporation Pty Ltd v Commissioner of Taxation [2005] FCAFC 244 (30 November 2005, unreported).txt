If this be right, then it is difficult to see why subs 43(1) of the AAT Act did not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to make that part of the decision against which this appeal is brought, namely, remission of the penalty matter to the Commissioner with the direction that the assessment for the year ended 30 June 1988 be amended by remitting additional tax in full. Subsection 43(1) of the AAT Act has been construed as not requiring the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal as being necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review: Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson supra at 39 40. In Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  FCAFC 244 (30 November 2005, unreported) the Full Court of this Court observed at  : '...Section 43 empowers the Tribunal to exercise all the powers and discretions conferred upon the original decision-maker, provided it does so for the purpose of reviewing a decision. Provided the necessary purpose is present, the power conferred upon the Tribunal is not otherwise limited. It is neither necessary nor permissible to put a gloss upon s 43 that would permit the Tribunal to exercise the discretion maker's powers and discretions only when those powers or discretions are necessarily interdependent with the decision under review, or where the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal is necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review see Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson . Thus, so long as the exercise of powers and discretions by the Tribunal is for the purpose of reviewing a decision, all of the powers and discretions conferred by any relevant enactment on the decision-maker who made the decision, can be exercised by the Tribunal' (Emphasis)

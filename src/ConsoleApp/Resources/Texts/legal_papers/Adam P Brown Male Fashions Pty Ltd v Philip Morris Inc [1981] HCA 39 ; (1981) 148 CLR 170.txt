Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc  HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177, the Court said: Nor is there any serious dispute between the parties that appellate courts exercise particular caution in reviewing decisions pertaining to practice and procedure. Counsel for Brown urged that specific cumulative bars operate to guide appellate courts in the discharge of that task. Not only must there be error of principle, but the decision appealed from must work a substantial injustice to one of the parties. The opposing view is that such criteria are to be expressed disjunctively. Cases can be cited in support of both views: for example, on the one hand, Niemann v. Electronic Industries Ltd.  V.R. 431 , at p. 440; on the other hand, De Mestre v. A.D. Hunter Pty. Ltd. (1952) 77 W.N. (N.S.W.) 143 , at p. 146. For ourselves, we believe it to be unnecessary and indeed unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria. The circumstances of different cases are infinitely various. We would merely repeat, with approval, the oft-cited statement of Sir Frederick Jordan in In re the Will of F.B. Gilbert (dec.) (1946) 46 S.R. (N.S.W.) 318 , at p. 323: "... I am of opinion that, ... there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights. In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of judges of first instance, the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice. The disposal of cases could be delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant with a long purse or a litigious disposition could, at will, in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a Judge in Chambers to a Court of Appeal." See also, Brambles Holdings Ltd. v. Trade Practices Commission  FCA 80 ; (1979) 40 F.L.R. 364 , at p. 365; 28 A.L.R. 191 , at p. 193; Dougherty v. Chandler (1946) 46 S.R. (N.S.W.) 370 , at p. 374. It is safe to say that the question of injustice flowing from the order appealed from will generally be a relevant and necessary consideration. The proceeding is listed for hearing on 27 March 2009. The Federal Magistrates Court has now advised that the applicant can appear by video should this Court entertain the applicant's application and appeal. It does not seem that there was any good reason to reject the applicant's application to transfer the proceeding to the Victorian Registry. The proceeding had only recently been commenced. Because of the provisions of s 477 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) the applicant could not delay the commencement until she moved to Victoria.

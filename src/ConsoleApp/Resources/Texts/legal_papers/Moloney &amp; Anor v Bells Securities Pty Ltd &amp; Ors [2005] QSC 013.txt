The reference to 'Bells case' is to the decision of Chesterman J in Moloney &amp; Anor v Bells Securities Pty Ltd &amp; Ors  QSC 013. In that case his Honour declined to allow as damages the costs of a liquidator appointed in circumstances similar to those in the present case. St Paul's argument seems to be that as the period of the ASIC exemption was to expire on 31 October 2001, a liquidator would have been appointed in any event. It is said to follow that the costs incurred by Mr Jessup were not a consequence, or perhaps a foreseeable consequence, of any conduct on the part of the respondents, particularly MDRN. The applicants did not take this point in argument, but it addresses the measure of damages in their claims against MDRN. 618. In causes of action for misleading and deceptive conduct and negligent misstatement, the relevant measure of damages is designed to put the applicant in the position in which he or she would have been, had the relevant conduct not occurred. That is often achieved by awarding the difference between the value of the property acquired as a result of the relevant conduct and the price paid for it. However there are limits upon the extent of permissible recovery. I accept that for present purposes, the test of reasonable foreseeability provides such limit. Had Project Results discharged its obligation, the loan would have been repaid in 2000. At the time of the relevant conduct it was reasonably foreseeable that the applicants would suffer loss as a result of Project Results failing to meet such obligations. It was also reasonably foreseeable that in that event, the applicants would have to resort to available securities, including Mr Rivett's guarantee, in order to recover their investments and interest. It was similarly foreseeable that, as a result of their conduct, MDRN and the trustee company would be unable to attend to such realization, and that somebody else would have to do so. That was likely to cost money.

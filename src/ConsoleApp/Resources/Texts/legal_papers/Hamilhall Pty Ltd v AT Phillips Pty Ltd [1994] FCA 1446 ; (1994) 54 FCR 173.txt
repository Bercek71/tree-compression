courts have recognised the importance of access to source financial documentation in the face of conflicting financial evidence (for example, Hamilhall Pty Ltd v AT Phillips Pty Ltd  FCA 1446 ; (1994) 54 FCR 173 , ALF No 12 Pty Ltd v Starkey  QSC 297). However the fact that source financial documentation is not available does not mean that the Court is unable to make a determination on a question of financial position (for example, David Towney v Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation for NSW  FCA 656 , ALF No 12 Pty Ltd v Starkey  QSC 297).

Of particular importance is whether the disclosure has been sufficiently clear. That is, the disclosure must contain clear and unmistakable instructions as to how to use the claimed invention: see Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly &amp; Co  FCAFC 224 at  ; Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd  FCAFC 220 at  and .

What matters is what is taught by the material: Evans Medical Ltd's Patent  RPC 517 at 576 per Laddie J.

The manner in which the Court approaches the task is also not in dispute. The Court does not resolve contested questions of fact or determine where the merits lie in any contest: Kortz Ltd v Data Acquisition Pty Ltd  FCA 1722 ; (2006) 155 FCR 556 at  . The Court determines only whether the supporting affidavits filed and served by West depose to facts from which the Court is able to conclude that a genuine dispute exists. As Young J said in John Holland Construction 14 ACSR at 253, something between mere assertion and the proof of the existence of the disputed debt is required: see also Micha International Pty Limited v Jong Seol Lee  NSWSC 921 at  and Solarite Air Conditioning Pty Ltd v York International Australia Pty Ltd  NSWSC 411 at  .

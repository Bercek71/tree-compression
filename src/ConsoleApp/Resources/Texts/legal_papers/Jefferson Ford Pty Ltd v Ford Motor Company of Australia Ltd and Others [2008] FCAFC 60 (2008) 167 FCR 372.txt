The federal magistrate then proceeded to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the appellant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding. It seems clear that a judgment given on such a basis is an interlocutory judgment for the purposes of s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), and that the leave of the Court or a judge is therefore required before an appeal can be brought from such a judgment. The relevant provisions of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and the relevant principles are set out conveniently in the judgments of Rares and Gordon JJ in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd and Others  FCAFC 60 (2008) 167 FCR 372 at  -  and - respectively. 7 Accordingly, there seems little doubt that the appellant needed to have leave to appeal. He was so advised both by the Australian Government Solicitor, acting on behalf of the first respondent, and by the registry of the Court itself, but did not file any application for leave to appeal. By O 52 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules , such an application needed to be made within 21 days after the judgment was pronounced, subject to the fixing of any later date. Not only has the appellant not attempted to make any application for leave to appeal, he has not made any application for the fixing of a later date than that prescribed by O 52 r 5, by which he might do so. 8 It was reported to me yesterday that the appellant's daughter came to the registry of the Court, handed over a bundle of material relating to the appellant's health, and informed the registry that the appellant would be unable to appear at the hearing of this proceeding today. The appellant certainly has not appeared in response to his name being called outside the courtroom. The material consists of a letter from the appellant, dated 26 August 2008, to the registrar of this Court, and a number of attachments.

The plaintiff submits that its offsetting claim amounts to USD781,900. The defendant has taken issue with the amounts claimed by the plaintiff, asserting that they are not supported by the evidence. The defendant relies on Macleay Nominees Pty Ltd v Belle Property East Pty Ltd  NSWSC 743. 41 In Macleay Nominees at , Palmer J was explicit that perceived frailties of evidence will not prevent a claim from being a "genuine claim" for the purposes of s 459H. His Honour held at  that both the cause of action and the amount claimed must be advanced in good faith. His Honour continued: "Good faith" means arguable on the basis of facts asserted with sufficient particularity to enable the Court to determine that the claim is not fanciful. In a claim for unliquidated damages for economic loss, the Court will not be able to determine whether the amount claimed is claimed in good faith unless the plaintiff adduces some evidence to show the basis upon which the loss is said to arise and how that loss is calculated. If such evidence is entirely lacking, the Court cannot find that there is a genuine offsetting claim for the purposes of s 459H(1) and s 459H(2). 62 Clearly, the evidence in relation to each component is not overwhelming, however, as Palmer J held at  in Macleay Nominees  NSWSC 743 : Many such claims at this stage of proceedings would appear to be tenuous, but if they are genuine then the alleged debtor company is entitled to the benefit of CA s.459G and s.459H.

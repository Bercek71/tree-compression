More recently, in Hansen Beverage Co v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd  FCAFC 181 , another Full Court of this Court said (at  to ): 34 In order to succeed in a passing off action, an applicant must establish, as one element of tort existing as at the date when the conduct commenced, that the applicant had the requisite reputation in the name or goods in the jurisdiction of the respondent and that there is a likelihood of deception among consumers or potential consumers resulting from the respondent's actions. An applicant must prove that there are, within the relevant jurisdiction, a substantial number of persons who were aware of the applicant's name or product and are possible consumers. It is necessary to show in a practical and business sense a sufficient reputation in the forum and this requires an evaluation of the size and distribution of the population of prospective consumers likely to be affected: see ConAgra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd  FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302 at 342, 343, 346 (per Lockhart J), and 380 (per French J). 35 The tort of passing off is designed to protect the property and goodwill of a business. It is only available where an applicant can show goodwill or reputation in relation to the name or get-up of his or her goods or services because they have become distinctive of his goods or services in a particular market. An applicant will succeed where he or she can show that a potential customer is likely to be misled into believing that the respondents' goods are goods of the applicant or are somehow associated with the applicant: see Cadbury-Schweppes Pty Limited v Pub Squash Co Pty Limited (1980) 32 ALR 387 at 393. 36 In Conagra 33 FCR at 381, in relation to a claim under the TPA, French J referred to the expression "a not insignificant number" of persons who would be potential customers as being an appropriate criterion. His Honour went on to observe that if the similarity complained of is "commercially irrelevant", having regard to the number of people who know of that similarity, then the name or get-up is not misleading or deceptive. 37 In considering the question of reputation, although s 52 of the TPA makes no reference to "reputation", decisions under that provision have referred to the need to prove a "significant" or "substantial" proportion of persons within the relevant market who would be likely to be misled: see 10th Cantanae Pty Ltd v Shoshana Pty Limited (1987) 79 ALR 299 at 301; National Exchange Pty Ltd v Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (2004) 61 IPR 420 at 440; cf .au Domain Administration Ltd v Domain Names Australia Pty Limited  FCA 424 ; (2004) 207 ALR 521 at 529-530.

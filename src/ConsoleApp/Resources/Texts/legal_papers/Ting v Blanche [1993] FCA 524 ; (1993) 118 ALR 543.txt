Where a corporation makes a representation with respect to a future matter, and the corporation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation, s 51A(1) of the TPA deems the representation to be misleading for the purposes of s 52 ; and s 51A(2) deems a corporation not to have reasonable grounds unless it adduces evidence to the contrary. See Ting v Blanche  FCA 524 ; (1993) 118 ALR 543 at 552 per Hill J and Phoenix Court Pty Ltd v Melbourne Central Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR (Digest) 46-179 at 54,432 per Goldberg J. Applicants who rely on s 51A do not, therefore, have to establish as part of a cause of action under s 52 of the TPA that the respondent did not have reasonable grounds for making the representation.

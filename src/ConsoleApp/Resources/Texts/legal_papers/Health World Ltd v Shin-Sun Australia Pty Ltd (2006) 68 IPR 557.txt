It is the case generally that the dismissal of a proceeding in this Court by consent can found res judicata and issue estoppels and attract the Anshun doctrine: see generally Maiden, "Recent steps in the evolution of res judicata , cause of action estoppel and the Anshun doctrine in Australia" (2004) 25 Australian Bar Review 130 esp at 138. As was said in Re South American and Mexican Co  1 Ch 37 at 50: ... a judgment by consent is intended to put a stop to litigation between the parties, just as much as is a judgment which results from the decision of the court after the matter has been fought out to the end.

This said, there is real controversy as to the extent to which decisions on appeal in opposition proceedings (whether by consent or otherwise) can found an issue estoppel or attract the Anshun doctrine in s 88 applications given the view of the Full Court in Lomas v Winton Shire Council  FCAFC 413 at  that an opposition proceeding had a "quasi summary nature". The Court went on (at ) to say that: An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails. In an expungement proceeding, the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored. That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding.

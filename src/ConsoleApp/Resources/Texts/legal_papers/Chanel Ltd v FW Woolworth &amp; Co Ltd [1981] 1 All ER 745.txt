The authorities indicate that the kind of exceptional circumstances that might attract the power of discharge or variation include where an interlocutory order was obtained by fraud or non-disclosure of material facts, or through an accident or mistake that occurred without the fault of the parties seeking the relief under O 35 r 7: see Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 at 549-551. The court's discretion to vary or set aside an order is to be exercised with great caution having regard to the importance of the public interest in the finality of litigation: Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc  HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 (' Brown' ) at 178; Baker v Beckett (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, Cohen J, 26 May 1998) (' Baker' ); and Chanel Ltd v FW Woolworth &amp; Co Ltd  1 All ER 745 (' Chanel' ) at 751. Similar principles apply to the variation or discharge of final orders: see Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2)  HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 (' Autodesk' ) at 302, 307, 309-310, 317-318 and 321. Further, as Spender J emphasised in Dudzinski in relation to O 35 r 7(2)(c), the rule is not an alternative to the appellate procedure in respect of interlocutory judgments, nor is it to be invoked for the purpose of allowing a party to present a case a second time to its better advantage. In my opinion, these principles apply, a fortiori, where the party applying for discharge of an interlocutory order seeks to reargue the issues that have already been determined by reference to additional evidence that was available to it on the earlier occasion but which it chose not to advance: see also Autodesk at 310 per Brennan J. 8 Ms O'Brien, senior counsel for the applicant, submitted that the respondents must meet a high threshold test in order to succeed in an application for orders discharging an interlocutory order. She cited Brown, Baker and Chanel in support of this submission. In Brown , the High Court held that a further order will be appropriate where new facts come into existence, or are discovered, which render the enforcement of the order unjust. Those changed circumstances must be established by evidence: Brown at 178 per Gibbs CJ, Aickin, Wilson and Brennan JJ. In Chanel , the Court said at 751 that: 'Even in interlocutory matters a party cannot fight over again a battle which has already been fought unless there has been some significant change of circumstances, or the party has become aware of facts which he could not reasonably have known, or found out, in time for the first encounter.' The applicant submitted that the respondents had failed to adduce evidence of any new facts or changed circumstances; rather, the matters relied upon by the respondents to support the application were wholly matters which could have been put into evidence at the hearing on 19 May 2006.

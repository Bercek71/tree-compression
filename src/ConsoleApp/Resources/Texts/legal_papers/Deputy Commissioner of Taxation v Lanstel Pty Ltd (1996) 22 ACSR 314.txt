J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, referring to that observation, held in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Lanstel Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 314 that the s 218 worked an assignment of the debt so that it became payable to the Commissioner. In doing so his Honour observed: A conclusion that, quite apart from prosecuting a recipient of a notice for an offence, the Commissioner has a legal right to compel the payments to be made to the Commissioner, and to sue for the amount if it is not paid, is left to implication, but the implication is clear. This conclusion was reached despite the then inclusion by s 218(3) of the discretionary power to order payment.

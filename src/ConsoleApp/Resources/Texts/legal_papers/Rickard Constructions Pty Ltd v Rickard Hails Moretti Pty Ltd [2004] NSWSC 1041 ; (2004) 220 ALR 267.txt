There have been varied opinions as to whether that basis can be applied by Australian courts without the High Court qualifying Poulton 89 CLR 540. As it happens, most negative opinions have been expressed by judges of this Court, eg Allstate Life Insurance Company v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  FCA 814 ; National Mutual Property Services (Aust) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd (1995) 132 ALR 514 ; Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd (No 4)  FCA 1106 ; (2001) 123 FCR 62 ; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Cridlands Pty Ltd  FCA 1413 ; (2003) 134 FCR 474 ; and Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd  FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146. A number of those and other authorities are analysed by McDougall J, who took the wider view, in Rickard Constructions Pty Ltd v Rickard Hails Moretti Pty Ltd  NSWSC 1041 ; (2004) 220 ALR 267.

Order 35A applies where a party is in default, which is the case here; O 35A r2(2)(b). It permits the Court to give judgment against the respondent in default under r3(2)(c) and r3(2)(d). Speaking of O 35A r3(2)(c), in Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd  FCA 433 at  , Heerey J observed: 'the rule does not require proof by way of evidence of the applicant's claim; rather that on the face of the statement of claim there is a claim for the relief sought and, of course, that the court has jurisdiction to grant that relief.'

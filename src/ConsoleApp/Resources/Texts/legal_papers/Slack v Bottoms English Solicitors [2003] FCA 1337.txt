is clear that a power of attorney as held by Mr Kerr from Ms Kerr does not provide a lawful basis for a non-lawyer to act for a party in litigation in a Federal Court (cf Slack v Bottoms English Solicitors  FCA 1337). However the Court has discretion to grant leave to a person who is not a qualified legal practitioner to represent a litigant. Such a person is commonly known as a "Mackenzie friend". I note that I consider it inappropriate that an application should be made by Mr Kerr to represent Ms Kerr without Ms Kerr being present. However I understand that in previous proceedings in this Court Mr Kerr has represented Ms Kerr in her absence. For the purposes of today's hearing, which is procedural only, I am prepared to entertain Mr Kerr's application to represent Ms Kerr.

The Tribunal did not reject the authenticity of the letters. It accepted them at face value. In those circumstances, it is hard to see why it would have thought it necessary or desirable to take evidence from the authors of the letters or form the view that further inquiries would provide material centrally relevant to the decision to be made (cf Prasad v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155). If there were inconsistencies between the apparent safety of those authors and the appellant's claims, as was put to the appellant by the Tribunal, that was a matter for the appellant to clarify. It was for the appellant to present his case. In any event, the Tribunal was under no duty to summons the authors of the letters or to inquire into their evidence ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB  HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at  per Gummow and Hayne JJ; Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Katisat  FCA 1908 at  -  per Bennett J).

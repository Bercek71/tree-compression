Counsel for the applicant referred to Hoffman v Chief of Army  FCAFC 148 ; (2004) 137 FCR 520. In fact, the submission was based on the approach to statutory construction summarised by Gavan Duffy CJ and Dixon J in Anthony Hordern and Sons Ltd v Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia  HCA 9 ; (1932) 47 CLR 1 (at 7) as follows: 'When the Legislature explicitly gives a power by a particular provision which prescribes the mode in which it shall be exercised and the conditions and restrictions which must be observed, it excludes the operation of general expressions in the same instrument which might otherwise have been relied upon for the same power.'

Notwithstanding this point however, I am not persuaded that the circumstances of this case are such as to warrant a departure from the usual practice of the Court in awarding costs so far as the costs of the first respondent are concerned. I form this view because: 1. I do not consider that this case exhibited special or unusual features so as to justify the court exercising its discretion in this way. 2. I accept the submission of the applicants that the case turned on factual findings, which in this case were against the applicants. To that extent I do not consider that the applicants' case against the first respondent was "hopeless" or had no chance of success. 3. I accept the submission of the applicants that their case was based on evidentiary or factual foundations, although as my judgment in the substantive case demonstrates, I was not persuaded by the applicants' submissions. 4. I consider that, as against the first respondent, the applicants, in particular the second applicant, had an honest belief in the soundness of their case (cf Ian David Morwood v Chemdata Pty Ltd  FCA 194).

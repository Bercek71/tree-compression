Some latitude needs to be allowed for the changing of a party's case as investigations reveal possible new arguments. But a line has to be drawn somewhere. Otherwise cases would never get to trial. When, as often happens today, and did so in the present case, there is no interlocutory injunction in place, an ultimately successful patentee may suffer loss which is difficult or impossible to quantify. In the present case B &amp; D claims that costs wasted or duplicated by reason of GMCA's fourth (19 December 2006) and fifth (18 April 2007) particulars of invalidity should be ordered on an indemnity basis. I agree. One of the established categories for which indemnity costs may be ordered is where a party has conducted its case so as to grossly prolong the litigation, thereby causing (the other party) to incur costs far beyond what they could reasonably have expected to incur in litigation of the genuine issues.

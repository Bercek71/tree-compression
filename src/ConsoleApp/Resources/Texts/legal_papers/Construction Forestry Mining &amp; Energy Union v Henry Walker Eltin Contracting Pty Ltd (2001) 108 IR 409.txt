In substance, Mr Urquhart's case was that: (a) When Powercor contracted out its meter reading function to AMRS in 2002 and 2004, part of Powercor's business (namely, meter reading) was transmitted to AMRS. For Mr Urquhart, counsel argued that meter reading was part of Powercor's business prior to the VMM contract. He argued that Powercor took back this part of its business when the VMM contract terminated and, again, when the Marshmans contract ended. Counsel contended that the Electricity Industry Act 2000 (Vic) ("the Electricity Industry Act "), the Electricity Distribution Licence, and the numerous regulatory Codes illustrated "both the essential part metering play in the distribution of electricity as well as the ongoing obligations of the distributor, regardless of whether or not the task  been outsourced". Counsel argued that, "y reason of the ... obligations imposed on distributors and conditions of licence meter reading and the related activities undertaken by meter readers  was more than an ancillary part of the business of a distributor and  in fact a necessary part of the business". He submitted that whether or not Powercor performed meter reading between the contracts was irrelevant. For the duration of the contract between Powercor and AMRS, AMRS had "what ... Powercor has within its power to give". Counsel for Mr Urquhart relied on PP Consultants Pty Ltd v Finance Sector Union of Australia  HCA 59 ; (2000) 201 CLR 648 (" PP Consultants "), Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations v Gribbles Radiology Pty Ltd  HCA 9 ; (2005) 222 CLR 194 (" Gribbles ") and Stellar Call Centres Pty Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal Plumbing and Allied Services Union  FCA 106 ; (2001) 106 FCR 302 (" Stellar Call Centres "). He also relied on Construction Forestry Mining &amp; Energy Union v Henry Walker Eltin Contracting Pty Ltd (2001) 108 IR 409 (" CFMEU v Henry Walker Eltin "), Minister of State for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business v Community and Public Sector Union  FCA 316 ; (2001) 109 FCR 303 and North Western Health Care Network v Health Services Union of Australia  FCA 897 ; (1999) 92 FCR 477 (" North Western Health Care "). (b) In these circumstances, by operation of ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement were binding on AMRS. Counsel for Mr Urquhart referred to the 1965 Award, 1969 Variations, the National Wage Cases , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement in support of his submission that, whilst employed by AMRS, Mr Urquhart was entitled to be paid wages and superannuation at the rate for which the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement provided, and not at the rate he was in fact paid by AMRS, but with the loading prescribed by the 1998 Award. He referred to the principles for interpreting awards in various cases, including in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (2006) 153 IR 426. He contended that, properly construed, the underpayment that Mr Urquhart claimed in his relief (see ) included the loading for which the 1998 Award provided calculated by reference to the 1999 and 2002 certified agreement rates (as well as the difference between the amounts for which these certified agreements provided and that which he was actually paid).

I have no hesitation in concluding that both the Commonwealth respondents and Mr Price should be entitled to their costs of the proceeding on a party/party basis. They have successfully resisted Mr Dunstan's claims. There is no reason, in my view, not to apply the normal rule that costs should follow the event: Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association Inc (1986) 8 ATPR 40-748. There were no significant issues upon which they did not succeed: cf Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 81 ALR 166. Their conduct did not unreasonably prolong the hearing; the reverse is the case: cf Latoudis v Casey  HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 544. There is no other conduct on their part which, in my view, would disentitle them from any of their party/party costs.

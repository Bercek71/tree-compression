In considering the approach of the Tribunal, the Tribunal's reasons must be read as a whole and fairly. I accept that I should not be concerned with looseness of language, nor review the Tribunal's reasons with an 'eye keenly attuned to the perception of error': Politis v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 20 ATR 108 , 111; Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd  FCA 322 ; (1993) 43 FCR 280 , 287.

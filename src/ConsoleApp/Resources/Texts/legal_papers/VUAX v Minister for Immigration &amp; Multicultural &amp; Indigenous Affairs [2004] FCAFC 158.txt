It should further be noted that this ground was not a ground raised for resolution before the Federal Magistrate. No satisfactory explanation has been provided for not previously raising it. Although this Court has a discretion to permit a new ground to be raised on appeal, there should generally be an adequate explanation for not raising the ground before the Federal Magistrate ( SZIBR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship  FCA 502 at  ) and leave should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so ( VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs  FCAFC 158 at  ). In the present proceedings, the only explanation provided yesterday was that this particular ground was inserted consequent upon a meeting between the Appellant and a migration agent.

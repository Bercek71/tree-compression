It has been said on behalf of the Applicants that whatever privilege may have attached to this advice has been waived. Reliance is placed by the Applicants upon Mann v Carnell  HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 13, where it was observed: Waiver may be express or implied. Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect. When an affirmative answer is given to such a question, it is sometimes said that waiver is "imputed by operation of law". This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences, even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege.... What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality... 12 The " inconsistency " relied upon by the Applicants is said to arise from the following two paragraphs of an Affidavit sworn by Mr William Beilby on 9 January 2008, wherein the deponent said: On 8 January 2008 I forwarded an Advice from Naomi Sharp of counsel dated 20 December 2007 to my client who resides in The Netherlands for his further instruction. On 9 January 2008 I received instructions from my client to file an Appeal against the decision of Justice Flick dated 29 November 2008  which provides that the Respondent attend Australia to be cross-examined on 1 and 2 May 2008. 13 It is not considered that there is any inconsistency and that there has been no waiver of the privilege otherwise attaching to the advice of Naomi Sharp. Accordingly, production is not ordered of that advice.

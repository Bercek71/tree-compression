Under the earlier legislation, Re Bradbury; Ex Parte The King; Official Receiver (Respondent) (1931) 3 ABC 204 had held that a penalty for a criminal offence was not a provable debt. In that case the relevant liability comprised a fine imposed for certain offences under the Game Act 1928 (Vic) and the costs ordered to be paid (although the judgment does not separately address the characteristics of that part of the orders dealing with costs). In essence, the liability was found not to be a provable debt because it was in the nature of a punishment. The question was, however, addressed in a somewhat different context in Re Caddies; Ex parte Stapleton (1962) 19 ABC 155 ( Caddies ). The bankrupt, before his bankruptcy, had been convicted of false pretences, fined, and ordered to make restitution within three months, with a term of imprisonment in default of payment. Before the three month period had expired, he became bankrupt. He was, however, then arrested for non-payment of the fine and restitution, although the bankrupt by then had made some part payment which well exceeded the amount of the fine itself. Gibbs J at 158 held that the order of the police court was of a punitive character, in particular as the magistrate had a discretion whether to make a restitution order, and whether to order a term of imprisonment in default of compliance with it. Once the characterisation of the order as being 'something in the nature of punishment' was made, it was not an order in the nature of legal process to procure payment. The Court concluded that there was no power under the Bankruptcy Act 1924-1960 (Cth) to discharge the order upon which the bankrupt had been imprisoned.

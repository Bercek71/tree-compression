Justice Weinberg has usefully set out some other key aspects of the HREOC Act in the recent decision of Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology  FCA 1325 at  to . I should note that Ms Bahonko submitted that the decision of Weinberg J should not be followed. However, leave to appeal from that decision was refused by Tracey J in Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology  FCA 1492 and in my respectful view, the statement of the relevant principles as set out by Weinberg J is correct.

The appellant contended that, by virtue of the way it dealt with the behaviour modification claim, the Tribunal's decision is marred by jurisdictional error: the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question, and as a result it failed to consider the appellant's claim properly: see generally Craig v South Australia  HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf  HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323; Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia  HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 (' Plaintiff S157 '); and Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  HCA 71 ; (2004) 216 CLR 473 (' Appellant S395/2002 '). For similar reasons, the appellant contended that Phipps FM erred in law. The appellant seeks orders that the Tribunal's decision be quashed and that the Tribunal be directed to decide the appellant's application for a protection visa according to law.

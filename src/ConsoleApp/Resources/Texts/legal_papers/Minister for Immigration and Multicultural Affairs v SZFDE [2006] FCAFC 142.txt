The Court observes that there is no statutory obligation upon the Tribunal to provide legal advice or to refer applicants to a migration service. Further, Scarlett FM noted that the appellant confirmed that she had sought and received advice from a solicitor on the Tribunal's Legal Advice Panel. The appellant retained Mr Deng as her legal and migration adviser, and is critical of the service she was provided in relation to her migration matters. However, misconduct on the part of a migration agent does not give rise to a reviewable error of law: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE  FCAFC 142. 25 In light of the extension of time granted to the appellant to enable her to prepare further written submissions, and the fact that she has had since at least 4 October 2006, the date on which she was informed of the hearing date of her appeal, to avail herself of legal advice, I do not consider a further extension of time or another hearing is warranted. 26 I can find no error in the decision of Scarlett FM or the Tribunal, and accordingly the appeal must be dismissed.

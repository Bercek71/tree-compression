ICI Australia Operations Pty Limited v TPC  FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 , Lockhart J said that the Act permitted the granting of an injunction to deter an offender from repeating the offence and in TPC v Mobil Oil Australia Limited  FCA 363 ; (1985) 4 FCR 296 , Toohey J said that even where there was no evidence to indicate the offenders intention to continue the offending conduct, it might be appropriate to mark the Courts disapproval by an injunction. In Glev Pty Limited v Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty Limited  FCA 916 ; (1994) ATPR 41-299 , von Doussa J pointed out that in applications for an injunction under the Act there is an element of public interest involved and the Court should be slower to withhold relief.

Rand J's classic description of the concept of interest in Reference as to the Validity of Section 6 of the Farm Security Act 1944 of the Province of Saskatchewan  SCR 394 at 411-412 is frequently cited, but it bears repeating: 'Interest is, in general terms, the return or consideration or compensation for the use or retention by one person of a sum of money, belonging to, in a colloquial sense, or owed to, another.' Most recently, this description was referred to, with approval, by Morris J in Director of Consumer Affairs v City Finance Loans (Credit)  VCAT 1989 at  ; see also Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 99 ATC 5193 at 5210  and Consolidated Fertilizers Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1992) 36 FCR 1 at 6.

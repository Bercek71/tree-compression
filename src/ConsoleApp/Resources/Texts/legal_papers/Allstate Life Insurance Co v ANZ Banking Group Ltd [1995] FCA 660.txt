The general rule under Order 62 rule 3(3) may be departed from where the party in whose favour the costs order was made was required by the interlocutory proceeding to "incur significant costs over and above those which it would have incurred had the opposing party acted with competence and diligence": Life Airbag Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Co (New Zealand) Ltd  FCA 545 ; where the proceeding is complex and its final resolution is a long time away: Allstate Life Insurance Co v ANZ Banking Group Ltd  FCA 660 ; Readymix Holdings International Pte Ltd v Wieland Process Equipment Pty Ltd  FCA 1297: Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 3)  FCA 347. 24 In McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd  FCA 1639 , Weinberg J adopted the observation of Lindgren J in Allstate that: ... the power to order that costs be paid forthwith should perhaps be used less sparingly than it has been in the past. That is particularly so in lengthy and complex cases where substantial costs have been thrown away as a result of ill-considered pleadings being drawn. Such costs should be capable of being recovered without the innocent party having to wait, possibly for years, for that to occur.

was a copyright infringement and breach of confidence case in which I previously delivered reasons for decision finding in favour of the applicant, Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd ("Krueger"), on the issues of both liability and quantum: Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd  FCA 803 (liability judgment) and Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd (No 2)  FCA 1493 (quantum judgment). The reader's familiarity with those earlier reasons is assumed for present purposes.

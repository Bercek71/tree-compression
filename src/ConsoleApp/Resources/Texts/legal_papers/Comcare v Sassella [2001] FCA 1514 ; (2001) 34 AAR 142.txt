respondents submit that with respect to an application before this Court to review the second respondent's decision of 5 May 2005 to direct the applicant to attend a psychiatric assessment under subs 36(3) of the SRC Act, the proceedings in the AAT make adequate provision for this decision to be reviewed on its merits: see Comcare v Sassella  FCA 1514 ; (2001) 34 AAR 142. In the circumstances, the respondents submit that it would be appropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion under subs 10(2)(b) of the AD(JR) Act and refuse to grant this part of the application. Section 10 of the AD(JR) Act, so far as is relevant, provides: '10(1) The rights conferred by sections 5, 6 and 7 on a person to make an application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court in respect of a decision, in respect of conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a decision or in respect of a failure to make a decision: (a) are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other rights that the person has to seek a review, whether by the court, by another court, or by another tribunal, authority or person, of that decision, conduct or failure; and ... (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1): ... (b) the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court may, in its discretion, refuse to grant an application under section 5, 6 or 7 that was made to the court in respect of a decision, in respect of conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a decision, or in respect of a failure to make a decision, for the reason: (i) that the applicant has sought a review by the court, or by another court, of that decision, conduct or failure otherwise than under this Act; or (ii) that adequate provision is made by any law other than this Act under which the applicant is entitled to seek a review by the court, by another court, or by another tribunal, authority or person, of that decision, conduct or failure. (3) In this section, review includes a review by way of reconsideration, re-hearing, appeal, the grant of an injunction or of a prerogative or statutory writ or the making of a declaratory or other order.'

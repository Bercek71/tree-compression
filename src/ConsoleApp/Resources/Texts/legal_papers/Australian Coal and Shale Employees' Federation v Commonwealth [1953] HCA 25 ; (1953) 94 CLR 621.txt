As already indicated, the Federal Magistrate's decision to refuse Mr Strangio's adjournment application was a discretionary one. The principles applicable on an appeal against the exercise of discretion are well established: see House v The King  HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 , at 504-5 per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ; Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation v Commonwealth  HCA 25 ; (1953) 94 CLR 621 , at 627 per Kitto J; and Ahern, at 146-47 per Davies, Lockhart and Neaves JJ. In order for an appellate court to interfere with an exercise of discretion, it is not enough that the appellate court considers that, had it been the first instance judge, it would have taken a different course. Rather, the appellant must show that there was some error in exercising the discretion, as for example, that the first instance judge acted on a wrong principle. In the present case, there is nothing shown below or in the affidavits filed or the submissions made in this Court that would lead me to conclude that the Federal Magistrate made any discernible error in exercising her discretion. Her Honour did not deny Mr Strangio natural justice as he would allege.

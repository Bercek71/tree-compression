It is accepted that a reasonable apprehension of bias must be " firmly established ": Re JRL; Ex parte CJL  HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 352. It is also accepted that it is not sufficient if the reasonable bystander merely " has a vague sense of unease or disquiet ": Jones v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission  FCA 1054 at  , 76 ALD 424 at 441. And the question as to whether a reasonable apprehension of bias has been " firmly established " must also necessarily take into account the manner in which the legislature has directed the Tribunal to carry out its functions (ie s 420 of the 1958 Act) and the inquisitorial nature of the review being undertaken.

The first respondent made an alternative claim for indemnity costs for the period following 28 June 2005. On that day, the applicants rejected a settlement offer, made by letter of 21 June 2005, for $23,248 "in full and final settlement of all the Applicants' claims in this matter (exclusive of costs), being the total sum of all disbursements you have claimed". Referring to Calderbank v Calderbank  3 All E R 333, the first respondent submitted that he should receive costs on an indemnity basis after that date. 18 As the first respondent noted, costs may also be awarded on an indemnity basis where a proceeding is unduly prolonged by an imprudent refusal of an offer of compromise: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 233 per Sheppard J. The rejection of a Calderbank offer does not of itself warrant an order of indemnity costs, even if the offeree fails to secure a more favourable outcome in the proceedings. In order for there to be an indemnity costs order, the respondents must show that the applicants' rejection of their offer was so unreasonable as to justify indemnity costs: see, e.g., Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 281 at 287-290 per Hely J. In this case, the applicants acted unreasonably in seeking to resile from the position that they had adopted in communications with the respondents prior to and at the first hearing. In my view, the rejection of the Calderbank offer was unreasonable in all the circumstances because, as at 28 June 2005 (after the directions hearing of 8 June 2005), the applicants should have appreciated that they would not be able to quantify the Commonwealth's loss unless granted leave to reopen their case, and that there were serious doubts that such leave would be forthcoming. This alternative basis would also support an award of indemnity costs in the first respondent's favour in respect of the period after 28 June 2005.

39 does not permit, however, an order to be made referring the whole of a case to a Registrar; it only permits a " subsidiary " part of the case to be the subject of a referral: Sharpe v Goodhew (unreported, FCA, Drummond J, Q I6 of 1989, 11 December 1992). Drummond J there observed (citation omitted): Rules such as O 39, rules 1 and 3 of the Federal Court Rules do not create a new cause of action or a new equity, nor do they confer a general right to an account in substitution for the trial of issues; these rules do not authorise the sending of the whole case to the Registrar, they only authorise the directing of such accounts as are subsidiary to determining the rights of the parties, thus emphasising that the main issue in suit cannot be disposed of by ordering the taking of an account ... One of the decisions there referred to by Drummond J was the earlier decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland in Rapid Metal Developments (Australia) Pty Ltd v Rosato  Qd R 82 where Wanstall J directed attention to the " arious rules of court providing for the taking of accounts " and observed that " hey merely regulate procedure in aid of substantive rights arising from other sources and put in suit in a cause ".

exercising its supervisory jurisdiction under Pt 9 of the Act, the Court has a discretion to refuse a scheme or confirm it with or without modification (s 194). Confirmation of a scheme pursuant to s 194 is not a mere formality ( ANZ Life Assurance Company Limited and ING Life Limited  FCA 806 at  ). The Court must have regard to the object of protecting the interests of policy holders ( Re Royal at ). It must ensure that the scheme will not be prejudicial to the interests of policy holders and that policy holders are properly safeguarded ( NULIFE Insurance Ltd v Norwich Union Life Australia Ltd  FCA 1635 at  ).

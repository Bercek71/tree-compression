determining whether what is claimed fits the description of a "manner of manufacture", one must confine one's attention to the face of the specification: Philips v Mirabella at 663-664; Advanced Building Systems Pty Ltd v Ramset Fasteners (Aust) Pty Ltd  HCA 19 ; (1998) 194 CLR 171 (Ramset) at  ; CCOM Pty Ltd v Jiejing Pty Ltd  FCA 1168 ; (1994) 51 FCR 260 ( CCOM v Jiejing ) at 291). The notion of a manner of manufacture does not incorporate considerations of novelty or inventiveness which are dealt with independently and comprehensively in s 18(1)(b), s 7, and the definitions of "prior art base" and "prior art information" in Sch 1: see Ramset at - (dealing with s 100 of the 1952 Act).

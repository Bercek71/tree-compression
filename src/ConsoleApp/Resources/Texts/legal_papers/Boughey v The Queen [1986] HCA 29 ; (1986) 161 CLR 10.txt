Citigroup's advice was given to Toll which was a person who was, or was "likely to become, an interested party" in Patrick: see Reg 7.1.29(3)(c)(i). In my view, in this context "likely" means a real and not remote chance: see for example Global Sportsman Pty Limited v Mirror Newspapers (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ; Boughey v The Queen  HCA 29 ; (1986) 161 CLR 10 at 21 per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ. It seems to me that Toll's past record of success in takeover bids, its core competence in the field, and the planning and effort which went into this bid made it likely, even as at 8 August 2005, that Toll would become an interested party within the meaning stated in the authorities.

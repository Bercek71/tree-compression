The control measures apply up to the point of retail sale with the states and territories remaining responsible for control of use matters. ... The agvet code focuses on the registration of chemical products, approval of active constituents, and approval of labels. The overriding criteria to be addressed by the NRA are public health, occupational health and safety, the environment, product performance, and trade and commerce. The public will be invited to comment in respect of each chemical product containing a new active constituent prior to determination of an application. The NRA will also be able to reconsider an existing registered chemical product to ensure it continues to meet contemporary safety and performance standards.

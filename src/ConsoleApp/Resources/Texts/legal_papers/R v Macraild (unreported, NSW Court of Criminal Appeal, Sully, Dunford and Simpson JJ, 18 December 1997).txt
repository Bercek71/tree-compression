Some confirmation of this proposition is available from the authorities. On two occasions, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has said that s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (which is in the same form as s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act ) reproduces the pre-existing common law. See R v Macraild (unreported, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, Sully, Dunford and Simpson JJ, 18 December 1997) at 9 and Watt v R  NSWCCA 37 at  . The pre-existing common law is found in Tripodi v R  HCA 22 ; (1961) 104 CLR 1 at 7 and Ahern v R  HCA 39 ; (1988) 165 CLR 87 at 100. In both of these cases, the High Court of Australia made it clear that the statement by B could only be admissible against C if there were 'reasonable evidence' establishing the existence of the common purpose, apart from the statement itself. I do not necessarily accept, as the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeals appears to have done, that the 'reasonable evidence' test is identical to the formulation 'reasonably open to find' preferred by the legislature. For present purposes, however, Macraild and Watt stand as authority for the proposition that, so far as they are consistent with the terms of s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act , Tripodi and Ahern are to be taken as providing authority on the proper construction of that provision. It follows that s 87(1)(c) must be applied on the basis that the admissibility of B's statement as against C can only be determined by reference to evidence other than the statement itself.

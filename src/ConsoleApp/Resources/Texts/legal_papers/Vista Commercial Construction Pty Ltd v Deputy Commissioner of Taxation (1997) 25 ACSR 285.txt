This limitation upon the power to extend time is implicit in the terms of ss 459F and 459C . Section 459F(1) operates to fix the time when a company on which a statutory demand has been served is taken to fail to comply with the demand. The significance of a failure to comply with a statutory demand is the subject of s 459C(2)(a) , which provides that the Court must presume that a company is insolvent if, during or after the 3 months ending on the day when the application is made, the company fails to comply with the statutory demand. The effect of ss 459F(1) and 459C (2)(a) is that the Court can only make an order under s 459F(2)(a)(i) extending the time for compliance prior to the end of the period for compliance, i.e., before the company is presumed to be insolvent. Within this period, an order extending the time can be made where a s 459G application has been rejected and that rejection is the subject of review or appeal. This is now well-settled: compare Vista Commercial Construction Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 25 ACSR 285 at 293 per Burchett, Hill and Emmett JJ; Graywinter Management Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 22 ACSR 636 at 638 per Finn J; Graywinter Properties Pty Ltd v Dyer (1997) 15 ACLC 302 at 306 per Ryan J; Buckland Products Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  VSCA 85 (" Buckland Products ") at  per Phillips JA; Shakespeares Pie at  per Barrett J; and Australian Beverage Distributors at  per Barrett. As Jenkinson J said in Livestock Traders at 54, ss 459F and 459C (2)(a) of the Corporations Law "premise unalterability of the time as at which a company is to be taken to have failed to comply with a statutory demand once the period for compliance has ended at a time when the demand is still in effect". This is equally true of the equivalent sections of the Corporations Act . The power to extend time after the end of the period for compliance would introduce a degree of uncertainty incompatible with the statutory regime: see also Buckland Products at  per Phillips JA.

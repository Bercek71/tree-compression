I do not consider that Mr Marzukie was motivated to hide anything from the Tribunal. The conflict of interest suggested between looking after the appellant's interests and his own personal needs, even if in breach of the Code of Conduct prescribed by the Migration Agents Regulations 1998 , has not been shown to be a matter Mr Marzukie would have been concerned about, or would have motivated his conduct. The real reason not to have the appellant attend the hearing was just the fact that Mr Marzukie wanted his child looked after by the appellant. Mr Marzukie may have put his interests above the appellant's but that could not amount to a finding of fraud. He described the 'interview' as 'important', but asserted that work was 'more important', which is more properly to be characterised as 'bad' advice: SZFDE  HCA 35 ; 237 ALR 64 at  ; see also SZHBC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  FCA 1310 at  -  per Spender J; SZHZT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  FCA 1661 at  ,  and  per Allsop J and SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  FCA 1980 at  -  per Besanko J. Further, even if there had been a breach of the Migration Agents Regulations , this would not lead to a finding of fraud in the relevant sense.

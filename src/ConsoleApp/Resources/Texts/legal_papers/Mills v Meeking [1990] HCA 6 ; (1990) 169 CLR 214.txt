The attribution of purpose by reference to context in the wide sense does not await the discovery of an ambiguity in the text. The purpose or object underlying an Act is often determined by consideration of the statutory context CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd  HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408 (Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gummow JJ). Nor does discovery of an ambiguity precede resort to extrinsic material under s 15AB. For as Dawson J said in Mills v Meeking  HCA 6 ; (1990) 169 CLR 214 at 235 (speaking of s 35 of the Interpretation of Legislation Act 1984 (Vic) in almost identical terms to s 15AA): 'The approach required by s 35 needs no ambiguity or inconsistency; it allows a court to consider the purposes of an Act in determining whether there is more than one possible construction. Reference to the purposes may reveal that the draftsman has inadvertently overlooked something which he would have dealt with had his attention been drawn to it and if it is possible as a matter of construction to repair the defect, then this must be done.'

One method for assessing damages is the licence fee or royalty method. Under this approach, the owner of the copyright recovers "a sum equal to the fee that would fairly be charged for use of the copyright work": TS&amp;B at . As Vawdrey properly conceded, such a method is often rejected if the court takes the view that the applicant would not have granted such a licence to the respondent because, for example, the parties are competitors or the copyright work was devised for a particular purpose and that purpose was frustrated or destroyed by the infringing use of the work by the respondent: see Bailey v Namol 53 FCR at 112 (concluding that lost profits is the better measure of damages where the copyright work was created for a specific purposes which has been frustrated by the infringement) and TS&amp;B at  (stating that the a lost profits approach is preferable to a licence fee approach where the plaintiff and infringer are "in actual or potential competition in relation to the copyright work").

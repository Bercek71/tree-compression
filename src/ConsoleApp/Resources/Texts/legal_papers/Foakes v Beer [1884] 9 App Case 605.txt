It is well established that mere forbearance by one party to a contract in requiring performance of obligations by the other does not effect a variation of the contract unless supported by consideration or recorded in a deed under seal. In Foakes v Beer  9 App Cas 605 the House of Lords held an agreement between judgment debtor and creditor that the creditor would not take proceedings on the judgment in consideration of the debtor paying part of it and the residue by instalments, was nudum pactum as without consideration. It did not prevent the creditor after payment of the whole debt and costs from enforcing payment of interest on the judgment. Lord Selborne LC said (at 613): 'If the question be ... whether consideration is, or is not, given in a case of this kind, by the debtor who pays down part of the debt presently due from him, for a promise by the creditor to relinquish, after certain further payments on account, the residue of the debt, I cannot say that I think consideration is given, in the sense in which I have always understood that word as used in our law.' Vanbergen v St Edmunds Properties Ltd (1933) 2 KB 223 involved an indulgence solely for the benefit of one party to a creditor/debtor relationship. Lord Hanworth MR, after citing Foakes v Beer, quoted from Smith's Leading Cases, and said (at 232): '... a creditor cannot bind himself by a simple agreement to accept a smaller sum in lieu of an ascertained debt of larger amount, such an agreement being nudum pactum . But if there be any benefit, or even any legal possibility of benefit to the creditor thrown in, that additional weight will turn the scale and render the consideration sufficient to support the agreement.' In Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ACN 005 357 522) v Ringrong Pty Ltd (ACN 005 496 855)  FCA 722 , Ryan J held (at p 37) that forgiveness of a debt not embodied in a deed and unsupported by consideration was 'ineffectual at law or in equity'.

recently, Lindgren J had cause to consider the operation of O 15 r 2(3) in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd (2005) FCA 366. Significantly, after reciting r 2(3), his Honour said at par 23: 'In the rare case in which the Court grants leave to a party to give a notice requiring general discovery, that subrule operates, rather than, as formerly, the Peruvian Guano test, to identify the discoverable documents. The Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Federal Court Amendments Rules 1999 (No 6) (SR 1999 No 295) stated of the new subrule 2(3) that 'he aim of the rule is to limit the documents that must be discovered to those which are directly relevant to the proceedings.' This interpretation is consistent with: &#8226; Order 15 r 5, which is titled ' Order for General Discovery ', and provides: 'The Court may, at any stage of the proceeding, order any party to give discovery in accordance with rule 2.' &#8226; the amendments to O 15 r 2 in 1999, the aim of which, according to the Explanatory Statement Statutory Rules 1999 No 295, was 'to limit the documents that must be discovered to those which are directly relevant to the proceedings' (note also Advanced Medical Institute per Lindgren J at par 23) &#8226; Practice Note 14, which states that orders for discovery will ordinarily be limited to the documents required to be disclosed by O 15 r 2(3) &#8226; Order 15 r 8 which continues to use the language of Peruvian Guano but only in the context of particular discovery and &#8226; the authority of cases to which I have already referred, in particular Spyer , Aveling and Advanced Medical Institute .

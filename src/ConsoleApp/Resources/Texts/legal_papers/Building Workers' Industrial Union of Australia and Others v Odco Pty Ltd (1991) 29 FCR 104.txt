Reference may also be made to Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia v Odco Pty Ltd (1991) 29 FCR 104, where the context was that the respondent carried on business of supplying labour by way of hire to builders, construction managers and contractors in the building industry, and the issue arose whether workers thus sent to building sites by the respondent were the respondent's employees or the employees of the builder. A Full Federal Court (Wilcox, Burchett and Ryan JJ) found that no contract of employment, however characterised, had been made between the worker and the builder to whom his labour was supplied, because the element of consideration essential to a contract of employment, being the promise by the presumptive employer to pay for services as and where rendered, was absent in that case. In so finding, it was pointed out that the builder's only relevant obligation in that context was to make payment to the respondent labour supplier.

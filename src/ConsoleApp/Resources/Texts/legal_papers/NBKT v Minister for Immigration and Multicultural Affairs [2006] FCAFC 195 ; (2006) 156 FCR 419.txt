The appellants argued that the tribunal had ignored or failed to consider DFAT report 404 because it gave no reasons or source for the finding that there had been a "considerable relaxation of the one child policy in Fujian Provence" when DFAT report 404 suggested that the policy was strictly enforced. The tribunal was actually aware of that report since it referred to material in it for other purposes on the same page of its reasons. Her Honour held that the tribunal's finding of a "considerable relaxation" was consistent with the 2002 Home Office Country Report: SZJTQ  FMCA 1188 at  . The trial judge said that the tribunal was entitled to form its own views as to the accuracy and weight of country information, relying on NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at 440  per Young J with whom Gyles and Stone JJ agreed. Young J had said that it was not for the Court to reconsider the tribunal's factual findings as to an applicant's claims and what country information was relevant to the tribunal in determining whether those claims gave rise to a well-founded fear of persecution.

my view these difficulties undermine the applicant's claim such that the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to O 15A r 6 is not invoked. I am conscious of the beneficial construction the courts place on O 15A r 6, the fact that the applicant is not required to establish a prima facie case, and the fact that in this case the applicant claims that it has suffered significant losses in respect of the business it acquired from the respondents and for which it has paid "good money" (TS p 17 l 28). Further, I note that, notwithstanding the provision by Mr Walsh in his affidavit of the 2005 and 2006 financial statements of the first respondent, Mr Walsh did so notwithstanding apparent instructions from Mr Cartan that no material beyond the 2007 financial statements be provided to the applicant (affidavit of Joe Walsh para 16). However as found in St George Bank  FCA 1360 ; (2004) 211 ALR 147 , confirmed by the Full Court more recently in Echo Tasmania Pty Ltd v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC  FCAFC 58 at  and Apache Northwest Pty Ltd v Newcrest Mining Ltd  FCAFC 39 at  and , each of the elements prescribed in subparas (a), (b) and (c) of the rule must be established. In light of: inadequacies and inconsistencies I have noted in the evidence advanced by the applicant supporting the existence of a cause of action; and the applicant's incorrect analysis of the 2007 trading, profit and loss figures. I am not satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated, on an objective basis, reasonable cause to believe that it has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from the respondents or any of them for the purposes of O 15A r 6(a).

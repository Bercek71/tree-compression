There was no need in this case for the Minister to go through a list of factors that might have informed her conclusion with regard to Mr Yalniz's children. Sometimes this may be appropriate but in other cases it may be sufficient, as in this case, to adopt an approach that assumes the relevant factors point to one conclusion that it will be in the best interests of children to remain with their parents: compare Sebastian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  FCAFC 31 at  per Tamberlin, Kiefel and Emmett JJ; Kaur v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  FCAFC 70 at  -  per Nicholson, Jacobson and Lander JJ; and Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Palme  HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 221 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ and 238 per Kirby J. The fact that she did not make a list of factors (e.g., hardship and children's development) does not in this case make good the proposition that she did not direct her mind to the matters that arose on the information before her. Having regard to what I have already stated, I think it plain enough that she discharged her obligation fully in this regard.

the second judgment, his Honour dismissed the application for review and ordered the appellants to pay the costs of that application and the costs before the Registrar ("the Second Judgment"); see McKinnon v Pattison  FMCA 696. GROUNDS OF APPEAL (i) Disqualification issue The appellants claim that Phipps FM should have disqualified himself from hearing the application because he had heard a similar matter previously. They also allege that the proceeding was part-heard before another Federal Magistrate. (ii) Substantive issue The appellants further allege that his Honour's judgment was made on "grounds that are not a factor for consideration" in the proper exercise of his discretion. (ii) Other grounds The appellants contend that Phipps FM failed to give them time "to read two submitted precedents" which were referred to in the reasons for judgment. In addition the appellants submit that his Honour "failed to seek the requested info from the respondent to be returnable 19 June 2009". Section 33(1)(c) of the Act provides that the Court may: extend before its expiration or, if this Act does not expressly provide to the contrary, after its expiration, any time limited by this Act, or any time fixed by the Court or the Registrar under this Act (other than the time fixed for compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice), for doing an act or thing or abridge any such time. Regulation 8.09(1) of the Regulations provides that: Where the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt claims remuneration under section 162 of the Act, the bankrupt or a creditor who is dissatisfied with the amount of the claim may, by notice in writing lodged within 28 days of being notified in writing or becoming aware of the amount of the claim, request a taxing officer to tax the claim. There is no provision of the Act which expressly provides that the time under reg 8.09(1) may not be extended or abridged pursuant to s 33(1)(c). DISQUALIFICATION ISSUE
